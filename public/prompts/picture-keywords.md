# Picture Keywords

You will be given a summary. Use your creativity to visualize an image based on it. The summary could be about AI, technology, politics, emotions, or abstract concepts. Approach it with imagination and create a scene that fits the essence of the summary.

## Key Points

1. Theme: What is the core message? How can it be shown visually?
2. Characters: If there are characters (human/AI), how do they interact or express emotions?
3. Setting: Where does it take place? Is it futuristic, natural, or abstract?
4. Action: What’s happening? Capture any action or dynamic unfolding.
5. Creative Freedom: Don’t just show what’s written—add your own interpretation. Visualize abstract ideas symbolically if needed.

## Examples

- AI Research: Show AI and a person merging into a shared learning process, or AI helping a person emotionally.
- Political Event: Illustrate clashing or collaborating ideologies symbolically.
- Human Emotion: Represent a person’s inner struggles or hopes with colors and light.
- Abstract Concepts: Use metaphors to visualize abstract ideas like progress or ethics.

Think outside the box and use your artistic vision to bring the summary to life.
