One of my colleagues lives in Stavanger, Norway.  Our\nteam’s semi-weekly standup is at 6:30pm his time, so I’ve been accustomed to\nseeing the window in his background be pitch black for the past six months.\nBut from one meeting to the next, his window went from pitch black to bright.\nThis led me to think about a basic astronomy question I had never given much\nthought to before — just how fast do the days get longer?  When Spring comes\nand the days are getting longer, how many extra minutes of sunlight do we get\nfrom one day to the next?  So I built a little interactive graph that shows how\nthe length of the day changes as a function of latitude, along with how it\nchanges from one day to the next:\n\n\n.wrap {\n  overflow: visible;\n}\n\n.plot-box {\n  width: 66vw;\n  position: relative;\n  left: 33%;\n  right: 33%;\n  margin-left: -25vw;\n  margin-right: -25vw;\n  overflow-x: visible;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical dashed lines represent the various solstices and equinoxes.  As\nexpected, for northern latitudes the longest day is on the summer solstice and\nthe shortest on the winter solstice.  On the equinoxes the day is exactly 12\nhours no matter what latitude you are at, and this is also when the length of\nthe day is changing the fastest — unless you are very close to the Arctic\ncircle (latitude 66.55°).\n\nOne of the more interesting features I hadn’t appreciated before is that when\nyou get close to the Arctic circle, the length of the days is essentially a\nzigzag, straight up from the winter solstice all the way to the summer solstice\nand back down again.\n\nThe math behind it\n\nSo what calculations are going into producing these curves?\n\nHow long is the Sun up for?\n\nThe first thing we need to know is how long the Sun is up for on a particular\nday of the year.  Spherical astronomy has a useful quantity that lets us\ndetermine this, called the hour angle.  The hour angle of an object is the\nangle it makes with the meridian (the line across the sky going from north to\nsouth).  Converting the hour angle into a unit of time (like hours) tells us\nhow long it will be before the object crosses the meridian (“transits” in the\nastronomical parlance).  Since we want the time from rising to setting, the\nlength of daylight will be twice the amount of time it takes between rising and\ntransit:\n\n\\[t_{\\textrm{daylight}} = 2H \\left( \\frac{24 \\, \\textrm{hr}}{360^{\\circ}} \\right)\n= \\frac{2H}{15^{\\circ}} \\, \\textrm{hr}.\\]\n\nIf we can figure out what the Sun’s hour angle is when it rises, we’ll have the\namount of daylight in a day.  To get this, we need to know two things: the\nobserver’s latitude, which we’ll call \\(\\lambda\\); and the declination of the\nSun, \\(\\delta\\), which is the angle of the Sun above the celestial equator.\n\nA diagram (from Prof. Fiona Vincent) helps to illustrate the setup:\n\n\n\nThe position of the object we’re interested in is labeled with \\(X\\) in this\ndiagram, and it shows the general case where the object is at some arbitrary\naltitude \\(a\\) above the horizon.  (Note that the latitude is labeled \\(\\phi\\)\nin this diagram.)\n\nWe know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle and want to find the\nangle \\(H\\).  To do this we can turn to the spherical law of cosines:\n\n\\[\\cos (90^{\\circ} - a) = \\cos (90^{\\circ} - \\lambda) \\cos (90^{\\circ} - \\delta)\n+ \\sin(90^{\\circ} - \\lambda) \\sin (90^{\\circ} - \\delta) \\cos H.\\]\n\nSince we want to know the hour angle of the Sun when it’s rising, we can set\nthe altitude, \\(a\\), to 0.  Solving for \\(H\\), this becomes\n\n\\[H = \\arccos (-\\tan \\lambda \\tan \\delta).\\]\n\nThis is the so-called “sunrise equation.”\n\nIn order to make use of this equation we now need to find the declination of\nthe Sun.  The Sun just moves along a great circle on the sky called the\n“ecliptic,” and to first order this motion is approximately constant.  So we\ncan model the Sun’s declination over the course of the year with a simple\nsinusoid:\n\n\\[\\delta \\simeq \\epsilon \\sin \\left( \\frac{T}{365 \\, \\textrm{d}} \\right),\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\epsilon\\) is the tilt of the Earth’s rotation axis (the “obliquity of\nthe ecliptic” in the astronomical jargon), about \\(23.45^{\\circ}\\), and \\(T\\)\nis just the number of days since the vernal equinox.\n\nPutting this all together, if you have a latitude and day of the year you can\ncalculate the length of daylight by using this formula:\n\n\\[t_{\\textrm{daylight}} \\approx \\frac{2}{15^{\\circ}} \\arccos \\left(-\\tan \\lambda\n\\tan \\left(23.45^{\\circ} \\times \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi T}{365 \\, \\textrm{d}} \\right)\n\\right) \\, \\textrm{hr}.\\]\n\nDaylight across the globe\n\nThere are a few interesting cases to consider in this equation.  First, let’s\nsuppose we are on the equator.  In that case, our latitude is zero, and the\nequation just reduces to \\(t_{\\textrm{daylight}} = 2/15^{\\circ} \\arccos (0) \\,\n\\textrm{hr} = 12 \\, \\textrm{hr}\\).  On the equator, every day of the year is\nexactly 12 hours long.\n\nAnother case to consider is what happens on the vernal equinox.  Now we set\n\\(T\\) to zero and once again the argument to the arccosine disappears, and we\nget 12 hours.  (And because \\(\\cos (x + \\pi) = \\cos x\\), this also happens on\nthe autumnal equinox.)  On an equinox, the day is exactly 12 hours long,\nindependent of latitude.\n\nThe last thing to consider is that the arccosine function is only defined if\nthe argument is between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).  But the argument to the function is\nthe product of two tangents, and the tangent function is unbounded.  Let’s see\nwhat happens on the summer solstice.  Here the \\(\\sin T\\) term is exactly 1.\nIf the product \\(\\tan \\lambda \\tan 23.45^{\\circ}\\) exceeds 1, then the\narccosine function will be undefined.  This will happen when the latitude is\nabove \\(90^{\\circ} - 23.45^{\\circ} = 66.55^{\\circ}\\).  This latitude defines\nthe Arctic circle, and at this latitude and above the length of daylight on the\nsummer solstice is undefined.  This is because at these latitudes the Sun\ndoesn’t set at this time of the year!  In the extreme limit of the north\npole, \\(\\tan 90^{\\circ} = \\infty\\) and the length of day is undefined all year\nlong.  At the north pole, the Sun rises just once per year, on the vernal\nequinox, and stays up until the autumnal equinox.\n\nThe derivative of daylight\n\nNow that we have an equation for the length of daylight, seeing how much it\nchanges from day to day is fairly straightforward.  All we have to do is take\nthe derivative.  Converting to the more useful units of minutes / day, this\nends up being:\n\n\\[\\frac{dt_{\\textrm{daylight}}}{dT} = \\frac{576 \\epsilon \\cos 2\\pi \\widetilde{T}\n\\tan \\lambda \\sec^2 (\\epsilon \\sin 2\\pi \\widetilde{T})}{73\\sqrt{1 - \\tan^2\n\\lambda \\tan^2 (\\epsilon \\sin 2\\pi \\widetilde{T})}} \\,\n\\frac{\\textrm{min}}{\\textrm{day}},\\]\n\nwhere to make the equation a little cleaner, I’ve used \\(\\widetilde{T}\\) to\nrepresent the fraction of the year since the vernal equinox.\n\nComplications\n\nTo get a relatively simple functional form, I made a few approximations in the\nplots and equations above.  What would we have to change if we wanted a more\naccurate calculation?\n\nAtmospheric refraction and the solar limb\n\nWhen calculating the length of day I assumed that the day began when the Sun is\nright on the horizon.  But this isn’t quite when sunrise is in reality.  First,\nthe Sun has a finite width, about half a degree, so when its center is right on\nthe horizon, half of the disk is above the horizon, and we would still consider\nit daytime.  So really we want to know when the top of the Sun reaches the\nhorizon.\n\nThe second complication is that at the moment we observe the Sun to rise, its\ntrue position is still, in fact, beneath the horizon.  But due to the\nrefraction light by the atmosphere, the light from the Sun curves upward to\nmake the Sun appear higher on the sky than it really is.\n\n\n    \n    Image credit: Hong Kong Observatory\n  \n\nTo take into account atmospheric refraction, we would not want to calculate the\nhour angle of the Sun when its altitude is zero, but when it is slightly less\nthan zero.  On the horizon, this effect turns out to be about twice as large as\nthe width of the Sun.\n\nTaking into account both the width of the solar disk (the “solar limb” in the\njargon) and atmospheric refraction, the altitude of the Sun at sunrise or\nsunset is on average about \\(-50^{\\prime}\\). (Though the atmospheric refraction\nvaries quite a bit due to weather conditions very close to the horizon.)\nUnfortunately this complicates the sunrise equation quite a bit since the\naltitude term no longer drops out of the spherical law of cosines equation and\nwe get\n\n\\[H = \\arccos \\left(-\\tan \\lambda \\tan \\delta - \\frac{\\sin a}{\\cos \\lambda \\cos\n\\delta} \\right).\\]\n\nYou can see how much extra daylight this effect gives you at different\nlatitudes with this plot:\n\n\n.wrap {\n  overflow: visible;\n}\n\n.plot-box-2 {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA difference in altitude of \\(50^{\\prime}\\) doesn’t sound like too much, but it\nadds a non-negligible amount of daylight to the day.  At the latitude of Los\nAngeles (\\(34^{\\circ}\\)) it adds around eight extra minutes of daylight to the\nday.  So strictly speaking the “equinox” is a bit of a misnomer — thanks to\nthe atmosphere the length of the day isn’t quite equal to the length of the\nnight.  Even at the equator where the effect is weakest there is 6 minutes and\n40 seconds of extra daylight on the equinox, so the day is more than 13 minutes\nlonger than the night!  And at higher latitudes the impact of atmospheric\nrefraction becomes even more pronounced.  At those latitudes the ecliptic runs\nalmost parallel to the horizon, so the Sun has to move quite a ways\nhorizontally to make much progress in the vertical direction.  For my friend in\nStavanger this effect adds nearly 20 minutes to his day during the solstices.\nBut at least until you get very close to the Arctic circle, the change in the\namount of daylight from one day to the next due to this effect is relatively\nsmall.\n\nEccentricity and the obliquity of the ecliptic\n\nThere is a second problem with the equation I used for the length of the day.\nWhen I calculated the declination of the Sun I just modeled it as a simple\nsinusoid:\n\n\\[\\delta \\simeq \\epsilon \\sin \\left( \\frac{T}{365 \\, \\textrm{d}} \\right).\\]\n\nThis is a reasonably good approximation, but it has two problems.  The first is\nthat it doesn’t properly take into account the spherical geometry.  You can\nimagine that in the limit that the ecliptic were tilted at \\(90^{\\circ}\\), the\nSun’s declination would simply increase linearly from \\(0^{\\circ}\\) to\n\\(90^{\\circ}\\) and then back down again.  Really the correct equation is\n\n\\[\\delta = \\arcsin \\left(-\\sin \\epsilon \\sin \\left( \\frac{T}{365 \\, \\textrm{d}}\n\\right) \\right).\\]\n\nWe were effectively using the small angle approximation of \\(\\sin x \\simeq x\\),\nalong with its inverse, \\(\\arcsin x \\simeq x\\).  Since \\(\\epsilon\\), the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, is (sort of) small, the approximation\nis only off from the true value by at most \\(1.5^{\\circ}\\), and this ends up\nhaving a fairly small impact on the change in the amount of daylight from one\nday to the next.\n\nThe other way that the simple model for the Sun’s declination is wrong is that\nit assumes that the Sun moves at a constant angular speed over the course of\nthe year.  But because the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, when the Earth is at\nperihelion (which occurs in early January), the Sun will appear to move\nsomewhat faster than average and when the Earth is at aphelion (in early July),\nthe Sun will move slower than average.\n\nTo account for the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit you’d have to turn to the\nKepler equation:\n\n\\[2 \\pi \\widetilde{T} = E - e \\sin E,\\]\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the eccentric anomaly and \\(e\\) is the eccentricity of the\nEarth’s orbit.  After solving this transcendental equation you’d then have to\nconvert the eccentric anomaly into the true anomaly:\n\n\\[\\nu = \\arccos \\left( \\frac{\\cos E - e}{1 - e \\cos E} \\right).\\]\n\nThis would then give you the ecliptic longitude of the true Sun rather than\nthe ecliptic longitude of the mean Sun.\n\nThe overall impact of the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit on the length of\nthe day is pretty minimal, however.  Over the course of the year the Sun drifts\nfrom west to east with respect to the background stars.  Because of this drift,\nthe length of the solar day is about four minutes longer than the length of\nthe sidereal day (a complete \\(360^{\\circ}\\) rotation of the Earth).  This\nmeans that near perihelion, when the Sun is moving faster than average, the day\nwill be slightly longer than it would otherwise be.  And around aphelion the\nday will be slightly shorter.  But even at these times when the effect is\nmaximal, the change in the length of the day is only on the order of 10\nseconds (unless, as always, you’re in the Arctic circle or very close to it).\n\nSo those are few ways to find out how long the day is, some simpler and some\nmore accurate.  If you would like to see the code I used to generate the\nfigures you can find it at this Jupyter notebook."
