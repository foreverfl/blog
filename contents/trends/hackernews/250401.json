    "content": "There’s White Stuff Growing on Your Cheese That Isn’t Mold\n\n\t\t\t\t Posted on November 6, 2018November 6, 2018\n\n\t\tTwo weeks ago, one of my best friends and ex-cheese comrades, Chelsea, brought our old mentor/boss-lady, the illustrious Kim Martin, into the shop. Neither of them had visited us before, and it was pretty exciting to show them around our little corner of the co-op.\nAs they were getting ready to leave, Chelsea pulled me aside and silently pointed at a quarter-wheel of aged Gouda on display in the back of the case, tapping the side of it to show me that it was all white.\n“It’s not mold,” I announced without skipping a beat. “It’s calcium lactate.”\nThis is something I actually have to write on the scale label when we wrap wedges of the cheese for sale, because people are inherently put off by a sheet of white on an otherwise butterscotch-orange cheese.\nAfter all, most people are familiar with white, wispy molds growing on the outside of cheese—either as the well-manicured coif of a bloomy-rind cheese or as errant growths on the cut face of half-eaten cheese hunks living in the refrigerator cheese drawer.\nBut there are other white things that can grow on your cheese, and they are actually desirable: crystals!\nYou know what I’m referring to if you have bitten into an aged Gouda, Cheddar, or Parmesan and felt that satisfying crunch. You also know it if you’ve sunk your teeth through the sticky orange exterior of a washed-rind cheese and felt a slight grittiness.\nPeople often come into the shop looking for cheeses that have “salt crystals” in them. As you will learn below, there are two “families” of crystals that form in cheese. Only one of those families has anything to do with salt—and those are not usually the ones people go hunting for in a cheese shop. While a cheese might taste salty and have crystals in it, that doesn’t mean the crunchy bits are salt, per se.\nThe crystals that people really want when they are asking for “salt crystals” are often referred to in the industry as “flavor crystals.” That’s because the sight of these crystals is a sign that you’ve found a flavorful, or fully-developed, cheese.\nIn fact, cheese crystals don’t have any effect on the way a cheese tastes—they are flavorless and scentless. But they do affect other sensory perceptions of a bite of cheese: sound (crunching), touch (bumpiness or rough texture), and sight (white spots, clusters, or patches).\nThere are several different types of crystals that grow in or on cheese at different times in the cheese-making or -aging process. They are either going to be the product of mineral (salt) emulsion during cheesemaking or protein breakdown (proteolysis) as the cheese ages.\n\nThe crystals you may not notice as much are the “inorganic crystals,” or crystals formed by minerals.[i] This “family” of crystals is created when salts emulsify, or disperse throughout the cheese without dissolving, during the cheese-making process.[ii] (These are the ones you could call salt crystals.)\nFor example, calcium phosphate crystals are most commonly found under the rinds of bloomy-rind cheeses, helping them become soft as they ripen.[iii] Two other kinds of inorganic crystals, Ikaite and Struvite, are what you notice when a washed-rind cheese has a gritty rind; Ikaite crystals are formed from calcium carbonate, whereas Struvite crystals come from magnesium ammonium phosphate.[iv]\nThe crystals that are most noticeable in cheese are the “organic crystals” that are formed by the breakdown of amino acids during the cheese-aging process.\nAs a cheese ages, it loses moisture and its protein structure contracts and stretches. As this happens, the amino acid chains running through the cheese that make up that protein structure start to break up; the whole process of protein breakdown is called proteolysis.\nEach type of organic crystal that you will find in a cheese is named after the amino-acid chain that broke up to create it.\nFor example, tyrosine crystals give aged goudas their famous crunchy texture. They can grow inside the paste of cheese, or all around the little holes inside a cheese.\nLeucine crystals have a similar effect, but have a more diffused, smear-like appearance than tyrosine crystals. Both of these types of crystals may be found in goudas, Alpine-style (Swiss) cheeses, and Grana-style cheeses (e.g., Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano, Piave, etc.).\nAnd then there is calcium lactate, which frequently forms on the outside of rindless cheddars as they age. Calcium lactate formations are seen as a sign that the cheese has aged for a long time and should have a more developed flavor profile.\nCalcium lactate originates from an earlier stage of proteolysis, when lactose is still present in the liquid milk that will be fermented into cheese. As the bacterial culture in the cheese eats up all of the lactose, or milk sugar, in the milk, the bacteria create lactic acid. [v] Calcium lactate is a byproduct of that lactic acid interacting with calcium carbonate in the cheese over time.\n\nJust in case you were wondering what calcium lactate has to do with amino acids, lactic acid bacteria convert the proteins in cheese into peptides, and then into amino acids (like tyrosine and leucine).\nYou can find several types of crystals on the same cheese—tyrosine and leucine crystal deposits on aged Parmigiano Reggiano, for example.[vi]\nSo how you do know which is which?\nGenerally speaking, calcium lactate will be found on the outside of a cheese (usually a cheddar), and tyrosine or leucine crystals will be on the inside. Calcium lactate can also form on the inside of cheese, but tyrosine and leucine crystals cannot.\nTyrosine crystals will be hard and crunchy, whereas calcium lactate will be slightly softer, and sometimes almost powdery or flaky, in comparison to tyrosine or leucine crystals.\nCalcium phosphate, Ikaite, and Struvite crystals will be found on any “mold-ripened” cheese: you may notice them in the slight grittiness at the rind of a bloomy rind cheese, like Brie or Camembert, or a washed-rind cheese, like Epoisses, Chimay, or Grayson. (Washed-rind cheeses, also called “smear-ripened cheeses,” fall into the mold-ripened category because their rinds are created by a complex ecosystem of molds and yeasts.)\nWhat all of these crystals have in common—other than the texture they create, of course—is that they signify age in a given cheese. They help mold-ripened cheeses become soft, and they let you know when a hard cheese has been nicely aged.\nSo if you peel open a chunk of Cheddar and find white deposits marbling its outsides, rejoice! You’ve gotten a well-aged cheese that is bound to taste delicious.\nAnd if you crack open a wedge of Gouda, Gruyere, or Parmigiano Reggiano and see little white spots either riddling the paste or clustered around the cheese’s eye holes, also rejoice! You’ve got tyrosine or leucine crystals, and that cheese’s texture is going to be like cheese candy.\n(Cheese candy, good readers! Could you wish for anything better?)\nThe moral of the story? If you see white on your cheese, don’t just throw it away. Touch the white stuff to see if it’s hard or soft. If it’s soft, it’s probably mold (and you can just cut it off of a firm cheese). If it’s hard, it’s a precious little colony of crystals, and you have hit the cheese jackpot.\n_______________________________________________________________\n[i] Tansman, Gil Fils. “Crystal.” The Oxford Companion to Cheese.

    "content": "The demoscene as a UNESCO heritage in Sweden\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 31, 2025 | ramblings\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe demoscene has become a national UNESCO-heritage in Sweden, thanks to an application that Ziphoid and me did last year. This has already happened in several European countries, as part of the international Art of Coding initiative to make the demoscene a global UNESCO heritage. I think this makes plenty of sense, since the demoscene is arguablythe oldest creative digital subculture around. It has largely stuck to its own values and traditions throughout the world’s technological and economical shifts, and that sort of consistency is quite unusual in the digital world.\nThe main idea of the demoscene is to compete with productions that maximize a certain hardware, but that’s not what all demosceners like to do. My demogroup Hack n’ Trade for example, cares more about making weird stuff, and there are plenty of other groups like that. Some demosceners don’t release anything at all, but might do important work to keep the scene alive (BBS-trading, organizing parties, preserving software…).\nI’ve written plenty of papers and blog posts about the demoscene, and I’ve often felt a gap between the stuff I write as a researcher and my personal experience of the demoscene. There is certainly an international demoscene with big events and huge releases that can be described in general terms, but what has mattered more to me is the local scenes, the small parties and the people you hang out with. Meeting up with a bunch of friends and making weird computer stuff “for no reason, really” is a great setting. That’s what I enjoy the most, in the end. For other sceners, it’s different.\nThere is a sort of diversity in the scene that is difficult to capture and generalize. The Swedish coder with a well-paid programming job and a busy family life might consider the demoscene as an escape to his teenage years, while the LSD-munching raver from France who trades illegal warez on BBSs and makes weird pixel art considers the scene as a free culture without corporate or art world bullshit. There’s room for both in the scene, because it is werdly conservative and open at the same time. And perhaps that is one of the reasons why it should be considered an intangible heritage.",

    "content": "We're excited to announce that Turso Offline Sync is now available in public beta!\nYour applications can continue functioning seamlessly, even when disconnected from the internet. Local database operations can proceed normally, with automatic sync occurring once connectivity is restored.\nHistorically, SQLite has been a database that excels at running local, embedded databases, because the database is just a file. For mobile devices, this means on-device databases.\nTurso takes advantage of this with Embedded Replicas — your local embedded databases, on-device or server can now be kept in sync with your Turso Cloud database, and any changes are propagated to all replicas.\nUntil today, our sync was unidirectional: while you can always read from the database, even if offline, writes happen directly to the Cloud, and are propagated later.\nThis has two consequences:\n\nWrites were always network-slow, since they have to contact the server for every request\nWrites could not work offline\n\nWith today's announcement, the local database will be able to accept writes that are as fast as a file, work offline, and later sync to Turso Cloud.\n#Use Cases That Just Got Easier\nOne of the things Offline Sync unlocks is the ability to create on-device local-first applications (in-browser is planned for the future, with \"the Limbo Project\"). Local-first architectures allow for fast and responsive applications that are resilient to network failures.\nCompared to other local-first applications, Turso's architecture allows for a simpler solution because it always syncs the full database. With Turso's multitenant architecture, you can control which data goes into which database (e.g., per user or per tenant), and then transfer the entire database to the device.\nAs well as on-device local-first applications, Offline Sync also simplifies many other use cases:\n\nMobile Apps — create truly offline-capable mobile experiences, including Expo-based React Native applications.\nPoint-of-Sale Systems — process transactions regardless of internet connectivity\nField Data Collection — gather data in remote locations without worrying about connectivity\nIoT Applications — Maintain local data storage with periodic cloud sync with Turso Cloud\n\n#What's available in the public beta?\nThe following features are part of the public beta:\n\nBi-directional sync (push local changes to remote and pull remote changes)\nRemote write support for embedded replicas\nWAL sync checkpointing\nConflict detection (but resolution is not yet implemented)\n\n#Getting Started\nYou are now invited to try Turso Offline Sync. The beta currently includes support for TypeScript, and Rust.\nMake sure to create a new database in your preferred AWS location:\n# Create a group in your preferred AWS location\nturso group create --location aws-us-east-1 offline\n\n# Create your offline-capable database\nturso db create --group offline offline\n\n#TypeScript\nMake sure to install the latest @libsql/client package:\nnpm install @libsql/client\n\nThen inside your project, make sure to set offline: true to enable offline mode:\nimport { createClient } from '@libsql/client';\n\nconst client = createClient({\n  url: 'file:local.db',\n  syncUrl: process.env.TURSO_SYNC_URL,\n  authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,\n});\n\n// Function to save a note that works offline\nasync function saveNote(content) {\n  await client.execute(`\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (\n      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n      content TEXT,\n      created_at TEXT\n    )\n  `);\n\n  // Add the note - works even without internet\n  await client.execute({\n    sql: `INSERT INTO notes (content, created_at) VALUES (?, datetime('now'))`,\n    args: [content],\n  });\n\n  // Try to sync changes with the remote database\n  try {\n    await client.sync();\n    console.log('Note synced to cloud');\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.log('Note saved locally, will sync later');\n  }\n}\n\n// Read notes function that works offline\nasync function getNotes() {\n  const result = await client.execute(\n    'SELECT * FROM notes ORDER BY created_at DESC',\n  );\n  return result.rows;\n}\n\n#Rust\nMake sure to install the latest libsql crate using Cargo:\ncargo add libsql\n\nHere's how you can use it in your Rust applications\nuse libsql::{Builder, Database, ResultSet, params};\nuse std::env;\n\nasync fn setup_db() -> Result<Database, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let db_path = env::var(\"LOCAL_DB_PATH\").unwrap_or(\"local.db\".to_string());\n    let sync_url = env::var(\"TURSO_SYNC_URL\").expect(\"TURSO_SYNC_URL must be set\");\n    let auth_token = env::var(\"TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN\").expect(\"TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN must be set\");\n\n    // Create a synced database with offline capabilities\n    let db = Builder::new_synced_database(db_path, sync_url, auth_token)\n        .build()\n        .await?;\n\n    let conn = db.connect()?;\n    conn.execute(\n        \"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS field_data (\n            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n            location TEXT,\n            reading REAL,\n            notes TEXT,\n            timestamp TEXT\n        )\",\n        ()\n    ).await?;\n\n    Ok(db)\n}\n\nasync fn record_data(db: &Database, location: &str, reading: f64, notes: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let conn = db.connect()?;\n\n    // Insert data locally - works offline\n    conn.execute(\n        \"INSERT INTO field_data (location, reading, notes, timestamp)\n         VALUES (?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))\",\n        params![location, reading, notes]\n    ).await?;\n\n    println!(\"Data recorded locally\");\n\n    // Try to sync with server if possible\n    match db.sync().await {\n        Ok(_) => println!(\"Data synchronized with central database\"),\n        Err(e) => println!(\"Working offline - data will sync later: {}\", e),\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\n#Mobile Apps with Expo\nFor those building local-first offline apps, Expo works great with Turso.

But it's a good reminder of how important the Zeroth Law of Debugging is (see below).Without some sort of online connection with these folks, and with transatlantic phone calls being very, very expensive (I was in the UK, they were in the US) fax was the obvious answer.I was reminded of this when I came across the actual fax itself:What I asked them to do was give me the output of /ppomr. Hitting / in 1-2-3 started the menu system and each letter took you down a submenu until you hit an actual menu item. /ppomr is /Print Printer Options Margins Right (read all about it in the Quick Reference) and so I was asking for the size of the right margin when printing.Here's what that looks like in action:And then I instructed the person on the other end to alter the left margin with /ppoml(/Print Printer Options Margins Left). I also told them if they wanted a change to the page headers I'd need to \"send them a disc\" (i.e. mail a floppy disc to the US!)If you are going to debug anything you need to tighten the loop between trying something and observing the output of your change. This should be the Zeroth Law of Debugging: get the smallest/fastest test case so you can iterate.Worst case send faxes across the Atlantic.\n\nat\n\nMarch 31, 2025\n\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to XShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest\n\nLabels:\nretro\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\nOlder Post\n\nHome\n\nSubscribe to:\nPost Comments (Atom)\n\nSearch This Blog\n\nLabels\n\npseudo-randomness\n\nhardware\n\nbabbage\n\nanti-spam\n\ngnu make\n\nretro\n\nsecurity\n\ncodes and ciphers\n\nthe geek atlas\n\nmathematics\n\nminitel\n\nbehind the screens\n\npopfile\n\nprivacy\n\nradio\n\nPopular Posts\n\nPimping my Casio with Oddly Specific Objects' alternate motherboard and firmware\nSome time ago I bought a replacement motherboard  for my classic Casio F-91W from Crowd Supply.

But I mostly care about how the model compares against the best available coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking), released at the end of February, which I have been using, and it has been a great experience.\n\nLet’s compare these two coding models and see if I need to change my favourite coding model or if Claude 3.7 still holds.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you want to jump straight to the conclusion, I’d say go for Gemini 2.5 Pro, it’s better at coding, has one million in context window as compared to Claude’s 200k, and you can get it for free (a big plus). However, Claude’s 3.7 Sonnet is not that far behind. Though at this point there’s no point using it over Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n\nJust an article ago, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was the default answer to every model comparison, and this remained the same for quite some time. But here you go, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead.\n\nBrief on Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro, an experimental thinking model, became the talk of the town within a week of its release. Everyone’s talking about this model on Twitter (X) and YouTube. It’s trending everywhere, like seriously. The first model from Google to receive such fanfare.\n\nAnd it is #1 in the LMArena just like that. But what does this mean? It means that this model is killing all the other models in coding, math, Science, Image understanding, and other areas.\n\nGemini 2.5 pro comes with a 1 million token context window, with a 2 million context window coming soon. 🤯\n\nYou can check out other folks like Theo-t3 talking about this model to get a bit more insight into it:\n\nIt is the best coding model to date, with an accuracy of about 63.8% on the SWE bench. This is definitely higher than our previous top coding model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which had an accuracy of about 62.3%.\n\nThis is a quick demo Google shared on this model of building a dinosaur game.\n\nHere’s a quick benchmark of this model on Reasoning, Mathematics, and Science. This confirms that the model is not just suitable for coding but also for all your other needs. They claim it’s an all-rounder. 🤷‍♂️\n\nThis is all cool, and I’ll confirm the claim, but in this article, I will mainly be comparing the model on coding, and let’s see how well it performs compared to Claude 3.7 Sonnet.\n\nCoding Problems\n\nLet’s compare these two models in coding. We’ll do a total of 4 tests, mainly on WebDev, animation and a tricky LeetCode question.\n\n1. Flight Simulator\n\nPrompt: Create a simple flight simulator using JavaScript. The simulator should feature a basic plane that can take off from a flat runway. The plane’s movement should be controlled with simple keyboard inputs (e.g., arrow keys or WASD). Additionally, it generates a basic cityscape using blocky structures, similar to Minecraft.\n\nResponse from Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nI definitely got exactly what I asked for, with everything functioning, from plane movements to the basic Minecraft-styled block buildings. I can’t really complain about anything here. 10/10 for this one.\n\nResponse from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nI can see some issues with this one. The plane clearly faces sideways, and I don’t know why. Again, it was out of control once it took off and went clearly outside the city. Basically, I’d say we didn’t really get a completely working flight simulator here.\n\nSummary:\n\nIt’s fair to say that Gemini 2.5 really got this correct in one shot. But the issues with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet code aren’t really that big to resolve. Yeah, we didn’t really get the output as expected, and it’s definitely not close to what Gemini 2.5 Pro got us.\n\n2. Rubik’s Cube Solver\n\nThis is one of the toughest questions for LLMs. I’ve tried it with many other LLMs, but none could correct it. Let’s see how these two models do this one.\n\nPrompt: Build a simple 3D Rubik’s Cube visualizer and solver in JavaScript using Three.js. The cube should be a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube with standard colours. Have a scramble button that randomly scrambles the cube. Include a solve function that animates the solution step by step. Allow basic mouse controls to rotate the view.\n\nResponse from Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nIt’s impressive that it could do something this hard in one shot. With the 1 million token context window, I can truly see how powerful this model seems to be.\n\nResponse from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nAgain, I was kind of disappointed that it had the same issue as some other LLMs: failing with the colours and completely failing to solve the cube. I did try to help it come up with the answer, but it didn’t really help.\n\nSummary:\n\nHere again, Gemini 2.5 Pro takes the lead. And the best part is that all of it was done in one shot. Claude 3.7 was really disappointing, as it could not get this one correct, despite being one of the finest coding models out there.\n\n3. Ball Bouncing Inside a Spinning 4D Tesseract\n\nPrompt: Create a simple JavaScript script that visualizes a ball bouncing inside a rotating 4D tesseract. When the ball collides with a side, highlight that side to indicate the impact.\n\nResponse from Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nI cannot notice a single issue in the output. The ball and the collision physics all work perfectly, even the part where I asked it to highlight the collision side works. This free model seems to be insane for coding. 🔥\n\nResponse from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nHere’s the output of the program:\n\nWow, finally, Claude 3.7 Sonnet got an answer correct. It also added colors to each side, but who asked for it? 🤷‍♂️ Nevertheless, I can’t really complain much here, as the main functionality seems to work just fine.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe answer is evident this time. Both models got the answer correct, implementing everything I asked for. I won’t really say that I like the output of Claude 3.7 Sonnet more, but it definitely put in quite some work compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n\n4. LeetCode Problem\n\nFor this one, let’s do a quick LeetCode check with to see how these models handle solving a tricky LeetCode question with an acceptance rate of just 14.9%: Maximum Value Sum by Placing 3 Rooks.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is known to be super good at solving LC questions. If you want to see how Claude 3.7 compares to some top models like Grok 3 and o3-mini-high, check out this blog post:\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet vs. Grok 3 vs. o3-mini-high: Coding comparison\n\nPrompt:\n\nYou are given a m x n 2D array board representing a chessboard, where board[i][j] represents the value of the cell (i, j).\n\nRooks in the same row or column attack each other. You need to place three rooks on the chessboard such that the rooks do not attack each other.\n\nReturn the maximum sum of the cell values on which the rooks are placed.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = [[-3,1,1,1],[-3,1,-3,1],[-3,2,1,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nWe can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 1) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation:\nWe can place the rooks in the cells (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) for a sum of 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: board = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nWe can place the rooks in the cells (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) for a sum of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\nConstraints:\n\n3 <= m == board.length <= 100\n3 <= n == board[i].length <= 100\n-109 <= board[i][j] <= 109\n\nResponse from Gemini 2.5 Pro\n\nGiven how easily it answered all three of the coding questions we tested, I have quite high hopes for this model.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nIt did take quite some time to answer this one, though, and the code it wrote is kind of super complex to make sense of. I think it answered it more complicated than required. But still, the main thing we’re looking for is to see if it can answer it correctly.\n\nAs expected, it also answered this tough LeetCode question in one shot. This is one of the questions I got stuck on when learning DSA. I’m not sure if I’m happy it did.\n\nResponse from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n\nI hope this model will crush this one, as in all the other coding tests I’ve done, Claude 3.7 Sonnet has answered all of the LeetCode questions correctly.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Link\n\nIt did write correct code but got TLE, but if I have to compare the code’s simplicity, I’d say this model made the code simpler and easier to understand.\n\nSummary:\n\nGemini 2.5 got the answer correct and also wrote the code in the expected time complexity, but Claude 3.7 Sonnet fell into TLE. If I have to compare the code simplicity, Claude 3.7’s generated code seems to be better.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, Gemini 2.5 Pro is the winner. We’ve compared two models that are said to be the best at coding. The big difference I see in the model stats is just that Gemini 2.5 Pro has a slightly higher context window, but let’s not forget that this is an experimental model, and improvements are still on the way.\n\nImagine this model’s performance after a 2M token context window.\n\nGoogle’s been killing it recently with such solid models, previously with the Gemma 3 27B model, a super lightweight model with unbelievable results, and now with this beast of a model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n\nBy the way, if you are here, Composio is building the skill repository for agents. You can connect LLMs to any application from Gmail to Asana and get things done quickly. You can use MCP servers, or directly add the tools to LLMs in the traditional agentic way.",

How did that work out for them?\n\n                    Simon\n\n                        22 Mar 2025\n                            — 5 min read\n\n            Photo by Everyday basics / Unsplash\n\n            1995: Steve Fossett became the first person to cross the Pacific Ocean in a balloon, OJ Simpson was acquitted of double murder and Coolio was living in a Gangsta's Paradise. The internet was something a mere 20 million people were using and most of them were doing so to the accompaniment of a screeching dial up modem. But some people were looking to the future. These brave prognosticators reached all the way through thirty years of time into what we now call erm... \"now\" to predict what life would be like in the mid-2020s.If you're going to predict the future it's usually best to aim for a five to ten year time-frame. This makes your predictions close enough to excite people but far enough away that everyone's forgotten what you predicted by the time it doesn't pan out. But in 1995, Ian Pearson and Peter Cochrane penned an article in the exciting-sounding British Telecommunications Engineering journal entitled 200 Futures for 2020 and over at the World Future Society, Joseph F Coates gave us The Highly Probable Future: 83 Assumptions About The Year 2025.The technology predictions of yesteryear are usually good for a laugh when the future they predicted stubbornly refuses to materialise on cue. Observe how many people are currently wearing their self-drying jackets and double neck ties as they zoom around in their flying Deloreans. Some of the predictions are so bang on the money that they do make you wonder if a certain gull-winged sports car was involved. The articles predict a global fibre-based broadband network (the internet), widespread demand for computer skills in employment, a handheld electronic device with contrast equivalent to printed paper (Kindle Paperwhite etc) and widespread use of solar power for national and individual dwelling electricity.In 1995 the world population was something like 5.7 billion people. At that time, Coates predicted a world population in 2025 of 8.4 billion people. The actual number is a little over 8.2 billion which is pretty close for a thirty year estimate. He was only out by approximately 1.2 Bangladeshes. 🦮One prediction for 2025 was \"robots for guiding blind people\" and guess what just turned up in my news feed? Meet Robbie, the walking talking robot guide dogInterestingly, although the articles talk about social, environmental and medical developments, neither of them predicted a global pandemic or the rise of antimicrobial resistance. In fact, their predictions on this front are often related to genetics with widespread use of genome mapping, genetic screening and genetically-engineered treatments for physical and mental health problems. As with science fiction reflecting the prevailing trends of the time it was written, so these predictions reflect a time when the Human Genome Project was underway and it seemed that we would soon understand ourselves and our ailments as the expression of our individual DNA-encoded firmware.Also missing is the explosion in mobile communication devices. The smartphone revolution means people all over the world now carry around with them a small computer that far exceeds the technical specifications of those that weighed down our desks in the mid-1990s. Cellular data services connect us like never before and, for better or worse, means that individuals have real-time global communication networks at their fingertips. The authors can probably be forgiven for not predicting that in the middle of the 2020s so many people would be spending their days mindlessly scrolling snippets of amusing, inane or downright inflammatory content from their fellow citizens.Three interesting predictions about money are listed by Pearson and Cochrane :Global electronic currency in usePaper and coins largely replaced by electronic cashPaper cash used mainly for black marketArguably Bitcoin fulfils the first bullet point and the second was rapidly accelerated by the pandemic and the desire for contactless payments. And while it's always been the case that untraceable cash has been the preferred payment system of criminals, in recent years electronic money in the form of cryptocurrencies has flourished in popularity for nefarious transactions. Small time drug dealers, international fraudsters, all the way up to nation states such as North Korea have seen the benefits of fast and largely anonymous transfers of money.Of course the fun bit of looking back at these predictions is looking at the ones that were miles off target. \"Passenger planes with speed beyond Mach four\" and \"superconductive magnetic levitation railways at 500 km/h\" probably seemed like reasonable extrapolations of current trends at the time. Robots that do your housework have been a perennial favourite of science fiction predictions since at least the 1950s but so far the only real example is the Roomba vacuum cleaner. Likewise, regular manned missions to Mars and a human colony on the moon aren't any more realistic than they were back in the 90s. The ever popular \"more recreation and leisure time\" also makes an appearance. Frequently predicted, probably since the start of the Industrial Revolution, it neglects to recognise that work expands to fit the time available to it. Increased efficiency seldom leads to a reduction in working time, it just means you can fit more work into the same number of hours. When was the last time your boss told you to take the rest of the week off because you'd finished all your work by Wednesday afternoon?We can be grateful that the predictions of widespread nuclear contamination at a level almost double that of Chernobyl didn't come to pass, despite the reactor at  Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant giving it a good try in 2011. As for the prediction that \"within the United States there will be a national, universal health-care system\", well, surely that can't have seemed very likely even at the time.There's plenty more to cover from these articles which I'll be doing in future posts but if you'd like to read the articles yourself check the links below:The Highly Probable Future (pdf)200 Futures for 2020 in British Telecommunications Engineering Volume 13 Part 4 (pages 312-318)\n\n                    Get the next instalment\n                    More commentary on the 1990s view of 2025 coming soon\n\n                    Subscribe\n\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o{--animation-duration:0.8s}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o *{opacity:.4;transform:scale(.75);animation:nc-loop-dots-4-anim var(--animation-duration) infinite}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(1){transform-origin:4px 12px;animation-delay:-.3s;animation-delay:calc(var(--animation-duration)/-2.666)}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(2){transform-origin:12px 12px;animation-delay:-.15s;animation-delay:calc(var(--animation-duration)/-5.333)}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(3){transform-origin:20px 12px}\n                @keyframes nc-loop-dots-4-anim{0%,100%{opacity:.4;transform:scale(.75)}50%{opacity:1;transform:scale(1)}}\n\n                Email sent!

    "content": "The latest addition to the long list of chemicals that I never hope to encounter takes us back to the wonderful world of fluorine chemistry. I'm always struck by how much work has taken place in that field, how long ago some of it was first done, and how many violently hideous compounds have been carefully studied. Here's how the experimental prep of today's fragrant breath of spring starts:The heater was warmed to approximately 700C. The heater block glowed a dull red color, observable with room lights turned off. The ballast tank was filled to 300 torr with oxygen, and fluorine was added until the total pressure was 901 torr. . .And yes, what happens next is just what you think happens: you run a mixture of oxygen and fluorine through a 700-degree-heating block. \"Oh, no you don't,\" is the common reaction of most chemists to that proposal, \". . .not unless I'm at least a mile away, two miles if I'm downwind.\" This, folks, is the bracingly direct route to preparing dioxygen difluoride, often referred to in the literature by its evocative formula of FOOF.Well, \"often\" is sort of a relative term. Most of the references to this stuff are clearly from groups who've just been thinking about it, not making it. Rarely does an abstract that mentions density function theory ever lead to a paper featuring machine-shop diagrams, and so it is here. Once you strip away all the \"calculated geometry of. . .\" underbrush from the reference list, you're left with a much smaller core of experimental papers.And a hard core it is! This stuff was first prepared in Germany in 1932 by Ruff and Menzel, who must have been likely lads indeed, because it's not like people didn't respect fluorine back then. No, elemental fluorine has commanded respect since well before anyone managed to isolate it, a process that took a good fifty years to work out in the 1800s. (The list of people who were blown up or poisoned while trying to do so is impressive). And that's at room temperature. At seven hundred freaking degrees, fluorine starts to dissociate into monoatomic radicals, thereby losing its gentle and forgiving nature. But that's how you get it to react with oxygen to make a product that's worse in pretty much every way.FOOF is only stable at low temperatures; you'll never get close to RT with the stuff without it tearing itself to pieces. I've seen one reference to storing it as a solid at 90 Kelvin for later use, but that paper, a 1962 effort from A. G. Streng of Temple University, is deeply alarming in several ways. Not only did Streng prepare multiple batches of dioxygen difluoride and keep it around, he was apparently charged with finding out what it did to things. All sorts of things. One damn thing after another, actually:\"Being a high energy oxidizer, dioxygen difluoride reacted vigorously with organic compounds, even at temperatures close to its melting point. It reacted instantaneously with solid ethyl alcohol, producing a blue flame and an explosion. When a drop of liquid 02F2 was added to liquid methane, cooled at 90°K., a white flame was produced instantaneously, which turned green upon further burning. When 0.2 (mL) of liquid 02F2 was added to 0.5 (mL) of liquid CH4 at 90°K., a violent explosion occurred.\"And he's just getting warmed up, if that's the right phrase to use for something that detonates things at -180C (that's -300 Fahrenheit, if you only have a kitchen thermometer). The great majority of Streng's reactions have surely never been run again. The paper goes on to react FOOF with everything else you wouldn't react it with: ammonia (\"vigorous\", this at 100K), water ice (explosion, natch), chlorine (\"violent explosion\", so he added it more slowly the second time), red phosphorus (not good), bromine fluoride, chlorine trifluoride (say what?), perchloryl fluoride (!), tetrafluorohydrazine (how on Earth. . .), and on, and on. If the paper weren't laid out in complete grammatical sentences and published in JACS, you'd swear it was the work of a violent lunatic. I ran out of vulgar expletives after the second page. A. G. Streng, folks, absolutely takes the corrosive exploding cake, and I have to tip my asbestos-lined titanium hat to him.Even Streng had to give up on some of the planned experiments, though (bonus dormitat Strengus?). Sulfur compounds defeated him, because the thermodynamics were just too titanic. Hydrogen sulfide, for example, reacts with four molecules of FOOF to give sulfur hexafluoride, 2 molecules of HF and four oxygens. . .and 433 kcal, which is the kind of every-man-for-himself exotherm that you want to avoid at all cost. The sulfur chemistry of FOOF remains unexplored, so if you feel like whipping up a batch of Satan's kimchi, go right ahead.Update: note that this is 433 kcal per mole, not per molecule (which would be impossible for even nuclear fission and fusion reaction (see here for the figures). Chemists almost always think in energetics in terms of moles, thus the confusion. It's still a ridiculous amount of energy to shed, and you don't want to be around when it happens.So does anyone use dioxygen difluoride for anything? Not as far as I can see. Most of the recent work with the stuff has come from groups at Los Alamos, where it's been used to prepare national-security substances such as plutonium and neptunium hexafluoride. But I do note that if you run the structure through SciFinder, it comes out with a most unexpected icon that indicates a commercial supplier. That would be the Hangzhou Sage Chemical Company. They offer it in 100g, 500g, and 1 kilo amounts, which is interesting, because I don't think a kilo of dioxygen difluoride has ever existed. Someone should call them on this - ask for the free shipping, and if they object, tell them Amazon offers it on this item. Serves 'em right. Morons.",

      "en": "The text discusses the dangerous chemical dioxygen difluoride (FOOF), highlighting its unstable and explosive nature. The preparation process involves heating a mixture of oxygen and fluorine at very high temperatures, which is highly risky and typically avoided by chemists. FOOF was first created in 1932 and has a long history of being studied, though few have actually handled it due to safety concerns.\n\nThe text describes experiments by A. G. Streng, who conducted a series of violent reactions with FOOF, including explosions with various substances like ethyl alcohol and methane. Streng's research is noted for its extreme hazards, as FOOF is a powerful oxidizer that reacts dangerously with many compounds.\n\nDespite its instability and potential for disaster, some research on FOOF continues, particularly at Los Alamos for national security purposes. Interestingly, a commercial supplier, Hangzhou Sage Chemical Company, claims to offer FOOF in large quantities, which raises skepticism about its actual availability and safety.",

A photo of a 1980s home computer, a cassette player and some tapes. The text underneath proclaimed \"In the 1980s, people could download video games from radio broadcasts by recording the audio onto cassette tapes. These tapes could then be played on computers to load the games\". I nodded sagely to myself as I remembered doing just that.Then I started to read the comments underneath and people were flat-out denying that this had ever happened. The reply guys broadly fell into two camps: the \"I have never heard of this, therefore it never happened\" and the over confident \"expert\" saying things like \"this would be technically impossible due to some fancy sounding words I've heard like 'hertz', 'compression' and 'frequency shift keying', therefore it never happened\".Just to make sure I was in a spluttering rage the page itself was titled \"Unbelievable facts\" as if my own childhood had become unbelievable. Although now I think about it it was an unbelievably long time ago, so maybe they have a point.My youth is now an unbelievable fact, apparentlyAnyway, come back with me to the UK in the early 1980s. Recession, strikes, unemployment and the first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, dominated the news. The home video cassette recorder was only just becoming common, the compact disc wouldn't be launched until the middle of the decade and mobile phone networks didn't even exist. Dexy's Midnight Runners, Irene Cara and Culture Club soundtracked the era and, across the land, the home computer boom was booming.Computers were new, barely making their way even into the workplace. Most people in office jobs were using typewriters, carbon papers and the postal system. But the microprocessor revolution promised to make computer skills essential to the economy and so the British Broadcasting Corporation began a public education exercise : The BBC Computer Literacy Project.The BBC's project is best remembered for the TV programmes fronted by Ian McNaught Davis and Chris Serle and, of course, the eponymous BBC Micro specially developed by Acorn to accompany the programmes. Less well known was a Radio 4 series called The Chip Shop. According to the ever reliable internet, it was presented by Barry Norman (much better known as a film critic than a technology expert) although I have no recollection of that.Home computers at the time were a marvel of cost efficient engineering. Usually consisting of a chunky wedge-shaped keyboard with all the gadgetry inside, it used your normal home TV as a display and a normal portable cassette recorded as a data storage device. Software (which for most of us meant games) would be supplied on an audio cassette on which a series of piercing screeching noises were recorded. You'd hook up the cassette player to your computer, play the screeching noises into your computer through a cable of some description and after a few minutes your game would be loaded up and ready to play. Or, more often, you'd hear several minutes of screeching before the process died with a cryptic message like \"R Tape Error\" and you'd have to start again.There were many different companies making these computers all competing for the nascent home market. And, with a few notable exceptions, they were all incompatible with each other and the screeching noises on cassette for, say, your ZX Spectrum would be of no use to the kid next door who had a Commodore 64. This presented a problem for Barry and his Chip Shop. The BBC wanted to broadcast software as part of the radio programme but they'd have to play a different set of screeching noises for each type of computer and their regular listeners would be subjected to twenty minutes of screeching noises at a time.The solution lay over the water in The Netherlands. The Dutch public broadcaster NOS had encountered the same problem and had developed a system called BASICODE. Often described as a kind of \"Computer Esperanto\", it allowed the same software to run on different types of computer. You would order a cassette that had BASICODE interpreters for different machines, load up the one that matched your device and then that interpreter would load up the BASICODE program you'd recorded off your radio.The BBC extended this system as BASICODE 2 (and later 2+) to include more functionality and support more brands of computer. And so was born The Chip Shop Takeaway. Late at night when anyone with any sense was asleep and not listening to their radio, the BBC would broadcast BASICODE programs for home computer enthusiasts to record and use on their machines. To call these \"video games\" would be a bit of a stretch as BASICODE didn't really support any kind of graphics but I certainly remember some very basic text-based games amongst a load of academic software which meant absolutely nothing to me as an eight year old boy.Nothing lasts forever though. The mass of competing computer systems became an unsustainable boom market. Manufacturers went broke, the range declined, technology moved on and the boom became a bust. Newer 16 bit machines eschewed cassette storage for new-fangled disk drives and the screeching of a BASICODE takeaway became a forgotten sound on Britain's radio waves. According to Wikipedia BASICODE 3 was also developed and continued to be popular in the old East Germany up until the early 1990s but for those of us in the UK it had already moved into the realm of \"unbelievable facts\".\n\n                    Sign up for Newslttrs\n                    Computers, Geekiness, Occasional Nonsense\n\n                    Subscribe\n\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o{--animation-duration:0.8s}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o *{opacity:.4;transform:scale(.75);animation:nc-loop-dots-4-anim var(--animation-duration) infinite}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(1){transform-origin:4px 12px;animation-delay:-.3s;animation-delay:calc(var(--animation-duration)/-2.666)}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(2){transform-origin:12px 12px;animation-delay:-.15s;animation-delay:calc(var(--animation-duration)/-5.333)}\n                .nc-loop-dots-4-24-icon-o :nth-child(3){transform-origin:20px 12px}\n                @keyframes nc-loop-dots-4-anim{0%,100%{opacity:.4;transform:scale(.75)}50%{opacity:1;transform:scale(1)}}\n\n                Email sent!

Luckily, if you worked from that post and are interested in what's changed, Una's also got you covered.\n\nThere's also shiny new documentation on MDN for customizable select, packed with details.\n\nMeet appearance: base-select\n\nA new CSS property appearance: base-select that puts the <select> element into a new, configurable and styleable state to be commonly referred to as \"base\" styles:\n.custom-select {\n  &, &::picker(select) {\n    appearance: base-select;\n  }\n}\n\nUsing base-select unlocks a number of new features and behaviors:\n\nChanges the browsers HTML parser for the contents inside the <select>.\nChanges the rendered internals of the <select>.\nExposes new internal parts and states for the <select>.\nA new minimal look, optimized for customization.\nShown options are in the top-layer, like a popover.\nShown options positioned with anchor().\n\nUsing base-select loses a number of features and behaviors:\n\nThe <select> doesn't render outside the browser pane.\nIt doesn't trigger built-in mobile operating system components.\nThe <select> stops taking the width of the longest <option>.\n\nExpect more \"base\" appearances for other elements to develop over time!\n\nA <select> can now include rich HTML content\n\nBefore you could customize a <select>, if you put things like an image or SVG into the <option> element, the browser would ignore them.\n\nConsider the following HTML, the browser would read it as you authored it:\n<select class=\"custom-select\">\n  <option>\n    <svg aria-hidden>…</svg>\n    <span>HTML</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <svg aria-hidden>…</svg>\n    <span>CSS</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <svg aria-hidden>…</svg>\n    <span>JavaScript</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <svg aria-hidden>…</svg>\n    <span>WASM</span>\n  </option>\n</select>\n\nHowever the used DOM wouldn't include the <svg>:\n<select class=\"custom-select\">\n  <option>\n    <span>HTML</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <span>CSS</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <span>JavaScript</span>\n  </option>\n  <option>\n    <span>WASM</span>\n  </option>\n</select>\n\nHere's (from left to right) Chrome, Safari, and Firefox rendering the preceding HTML. If the browser supports appearance: base-select then the SVG will appear in the option, otherwise it won't.\n\n  Try it in this Codepen.\n\nThere's risk in breaking existing websites with customizable select, due to the parser changes. Chrome has the features behind a Finch experiment in case there is an emergency need to turn it off. If things go well, the experiment will end and the code will be shipped permanently into the source.\n\nCompletely customizable\n\nEvery part of a base-select can be swapped out, customized and animated. Here's a demo that uses every new feature to create recognizable and meaningful select experiences.\n\n  Try it in this Codepen.\n\nFind many more examples in the resources section at the end of this post.\n\nUnchanged JavaScript interfaces\n\nThere's no risks to your existing JavaScript interactions with a <select> element.\n\nHowever, if you do begin adding rich HTML into your <option> elements, you should test the selected values, as the browser does still parse and ignore images and SVG. The logic has changed though, for determining the selected content string, and depending on what you have in your options, you may need to make adjustments.\n\nIf you're using the value attribute on an <option> you have nothing to worry about.\n\nResources\n\nChrome is first to implement base-select, but every browser participated in the specifications, and there's more \"base\" elements yet to be completed. This is just a start.\n\nStay tuned as we'll be continuing to add guidance, examples and resources on customizing select elements.

    "content": "C and C++ Prioritize Performance over Correctness\n\n            Posted on Friday, August 18, 2023.\n\n          PDF\n\nThe original ANSI C standard, C89, introduced the concept of “undefined behavior,”\nwhich was used both to describe the effect of outright bugs like\naccessing memory in a freed object\nand also to capture the fact that existing implementations differed about\nhandling certain aspects of the language,\nincluding use of uninitialized values,\nsigned integer overflow, and null pointer handling.\n\nThe C89 spec defined undefined behavior (in section 1.6) as:\n\nUndefined behavior—behavior, upon use of a nonportable or\nerroneous program construct, of erroneous data, or of\nindeterminately-valued objects, for which the Standard imposes no\nrequirements.  Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the\nsituation completely with unpredictable results, to behaving during\ntranslation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic\nof the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic\nmessage), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance\nof a diagnostic message).\n\nLumping both non-portable and buggy code into the same category was a mistake.\nAs time has gone on, the way compilers treat undefined behavior\nhas led to more and more unexpectedly broken programs,\nto the point where it is becoming difficult to tell whether any program\nwill compile to the meaning in the original source.\nThis post looks at a few examples and then tries to make some general observations.\nIn particular, today’s C and C++ prioritize\nperformance to the clear detriment of correctness.\nUninitialized variables\n\nC and C++ do not require variables to be initialized\non declaration (explicitly or implicitly) like Go and Java.\nReading from an uninitialized variable is undefined behavior.\n\nIn a blog post,\nChris Lattner (creator of LLVM and Clang) explains the rationale:\n\nUse of an uninitialized variable:\nThis is commonly known as source of problems in C programs\nand there are many tools to catch these:\nfrom compiler warnings to static and dynamic analyzers.\nThis improves performance by not requiring that all variables\nbe zero initialized when they come into scope (as Java does).\nFor most scalar variables, this would cause little overhead,\nbut stack arrays and malloc’d memory would incur\na memset of the storage, which could be quite costly,\nparticularly since the storage is usually completely overwritten.\n\nEarly C compilers were too crude to detect\nuse of uninitialized basic variables like integers and pointers,\nbut modern compilers are dramatically more sophisticated.\nThey could absolutely react in these cases by\n“terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance\nof a diagnostic message),”\nwhich is to say reporting a compile error.\nOr, if they were worried about not rejecting old programs,\nthey could insert a zero initialization with, as Lattner admits, little overhead.\nBut they don’t do either of these.\nInstead, they just do whatever they feel like during code generation.\n\nFor example, here’s a simple C++ program with an uninitialized variable (a bug):\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    for(int i; i < 10; i++) {\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nIf you compile this with clang++ -O1, it deletes the loop entirely:\nmain contains only the return 0.\nIn effect, Clang has noticed the uninitialized variable and chosen\nnot to report the error to the user but instead\nto pretend i is always initialized above 10, making the loop disappear.\n\nIt is true that if you compile with -Wall, then Clang does report the\nuse of the uninitialized variable as a warning.\nThis is why you should always build with and fix warnings in C and C++ programs.\nBut not all compiler-optimized undefined behaviors\nare reliably reported as warnings.\nArithmetic overflow\n\nAt the time C89 was standardized, there were still legacy\nones’-complement computers,\nso ANSI C could not assume the now-standard two’s-complement representation\nfor negative numbers.\nIn two’s complement, an int8 −1 is 0b11111111;\nin ones’ complement that’s −0, while −1 is 0b11111110.\nThis meant that operations like signed integer overflow could not be defined,\nbecause\n\nint8 127+1 = 0b01111111+1 = 0b10000000\n\nis −127 in ones’ complement but −128 in two’s complement.\nThat is, signed integer overflow was non-portable.\nDeclaring it undefined behavior let compilers escalate the behavior\nfrom “non-portable”, with one of two clear meanings,\nto whatever they feel like doing.\nFor example, a common thing programmers expect is that you can test\nfor signed integer overflow by checking whether the result is\nless than one of the operands, as in this program:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint f(int x) {\n    if(x+100 < x)\n        printf(\"overflow\\n\");\n    return x+100;\n}\n\nClang optimizes away the if statement.\nThe justification is that since signed integer overflow is undefined behavior,\nthe compiler can assume it never happens, so x+100 must never be less than x.\nIronically, this program would correctly detect overflow\non both ones’-complement and two’s-complement machines\nif the compiler would actually emit the check.\n\nIn this case, clang++ -O1 -Wall prints no warning while it deletes the if statement,\nand neither does g++,\nalthough I seem to remember it used to, perhaps in subtly different situations\nor with different flags.\n\nFor C++20, the first version of proposal P0907\nsuggested standardizing that signed integer overflow\nwraps in two’s complement. The original draft gave a very clear statement of the history\nof the undefined behavior and the motivation for making a change:\n\n[C11] Integer types allows three representations for signed integral types:\n\nSigned magnitude\n\nOnes’ complement\n\nTwo’s complement\n\nSee §4 C Signed Integer Wording for full wording.\n\nC++ inherits these three signed integer representations from C. To the author’s knowledge no modern machine uses both C++ and a signed integer representation other than two’s complement (see §5 Survey of Signed Integer Representations). None of [MSVC], [GCC], and [LLVM] support other representations. This means that the C++ that is taught is effectively two’s complement, and the C++ that is written is two’s complement. It is extremely unlikely that there exist any significant code base developed for two’s complement machines that would actually work when run on a non-two’s complement machine.\n\nThe C++ that is spec’d, however, is not two’s complement. Signed integers currently allow for trap representations, extra padding bits, integral negative zero, and introduce undefined behavior and implementation-defined behavior for the sake of this extremely abstract machine.\n\nSpecifically, the current wording has the following effects:\n\nAssociativity and commutativity of integers is needlessly obtuse.\n\nNaïve overflow checks, which are often security-critical, often get eliminated by compilers. This leads to exploitable code when the intent was clearly not to and the code, while naïve, was correctly performing security checks for two’s complement integers. Correct overflow checks are difficult to write and equally difficult to read, exponentially so in generic code.\n\nConversion between signed and unsigned are implementation-defined.\n\nThere is no portable way to generate an arithmetic right-shift, or to sign-extend an integer, which every modern CPU supports.\n\nconstexpr is further restrained by this extraneous undefined behavior.\n\nAtomic integral are already two’s complement and have no undefined results, therefore even freestanding implementations already support two’s complement in C++.\n\nLet’s stop pretending that the C++ abstract machine should represent integers as signed magnitude or ones’ complement. These theoretical implementations are a different programming language, not our real-world C++. Users of C++ who require signed magnitude or ones’ complement integers would be better served by a pure-library solution, and so would the rest of us.\n\nIn the end, the C++ standards committee put up “strong resistance against” the idea of defining\nsigned integer overflow the way every programmer expects; the undefined behavior remains.\nInfinite loops\n\nA programmer would never accidentally cause a program to execute an infinite loop, would they?\nConsider this program:\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint stop = 1;\n\nvoid maybeStop() {\n    if(stop)\n        for(;;);\n}\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"hello, \");\n    maybeStop();\n    printf(\"world\\n\");\n}\n\nThis seems like a completely reasonable program to write. Perhaps you are debugging and want the program to stop so you can attach a debugger. Changing the initializer for stop to 0 lets the program run to completion.\nBut it turns out that, at least with the latest Clang, the program runs to completion anyway:\nthe call to maybeStop is optimized away entirely, even when stop is 1.\n\nThe problem is that C++ defines that every side-effect-free loop may be assumed by the compiler to terminate.\nThat is, a loop that does not terminate is therefore undefined behavior.\nThis is purely for compiler optimizations, once again treated as more important than correctness.\nThe rationale for this decision played out in the C standard and was more or less adopted in the C++ standard as well.\n\nJohn Regehr pointed out this problem in his post\n“C Compilers Disprove Fermat’s Last Theorem,”\nwhich included this entry in a FAQ:\n\nQ: Does the C standard permit/forbid the compiler to terminate infinite loops?\n\nA: The compiler is given considerable freedom in how it implements the C program,\nbut its output must have the same externally visible behavior that the program would have when interpreted by the “C abstract machine” that is described in the standard.  Many knowledgeable people (including me) read this as saying that the termination behavior of a program must not be changed.  Obviously some compiler writers disagree, or else don’t believe that it matters.  The fact that reasonable people disagree on the interpretation would seem to indicate that the C standard is flawed.\n\nA few months later, Douglas Walls wrote WG14/N1509: Optimizing away infinite loops,\nmaking the case that the standard should not allow this optimization.\nIn response, Hans-J. Boehm wrote\nWG14/N1528: Why undefined behavior for infinite loops?,\narguing for allowing the optimization.\n\nConsider the potential optimization of this code:\nfor (p = q; p != 0; p = p->next)\n    ++count;\nfor (p = q; p != 0; p = p->next)\n    ++count2;\n\nA sufficiently smart compiler might reduce it to this code:\nfor (p = q; p != 0; p = p->next) {\n        ++count;\n        ++count2;\n}\n\nIs that safe? Not if the first loop is an infinite loop. If the list at p is cyclic and another thread is modifying count2,\nthen the first program has no race, while the second program does.\nCompilers clearly can’t turn correct, race-free programs into racy programs.\nBut what if we declare that infinite loops are not correct programs?\nThat is, what if infinite loops were undefined behavior?\nThen the compiler could optimize to its robotic heart’s content.\nThis is exactly what the C standards committee decided to do.\n\nThe rationale, paraphrased, was:\n\nIt is very difficult to tell if a given loop is infinite.\n\nInfinite loops are rare and typically unintentional.\n\nThere are many loop optimizations that are only valid for non-infinite loops.\n\nThe performance wins of these optimizations are deemed important.\n\nSome compilers already apply these optimizations, making infinite loops non-portable too.\n\nTherefore, we should declare programs with infinite loops undefined behavior, enabling the optimizations.\nNull pointer usage\n\nWe’ve all seen how dereferencing a null pointer causes a crash on modern operating systems:\nthey leave page zero unmapped by default precisely for this purpose.\nBut not all systems where C and C++ run have hardware memory protection.\nFor example, I wrote my first C and C++ programs using Turbo C on an MS-DOS system.\nReading or writing a null pointer did not cause any kind of fault:\nthe program just touched the memory at location zero and kept running.\nThe correctness of my code improved dramatically when I moved to\na Unix system that made those programs crash at the moment of the mistake.\nBecause the behavior is non-portable, though, dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior.\n\nAt some point, the justification for keeping the undefined behavior became performance.\nChris Lattner explains:\n\nIn C-based languages, NULL being undefined enables a large number of simple scalar optimizations that are exposed as a result of macro expansion and inlining.\n\nIn an earlier post, I showed this example, lifted from Twitter in 2017:\n#include <cstdlib>\n\ntypedef int (*Function)();\n\nstatic Function Do;\n\nstatic int EraseAll() {\n    return system(\"rm -rf slash\");\n}\n\nvoid NeverCalled() {\n    Do = EraseAll;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    return Do();\n}\n\nBecause calling Do() is undefined behavior when Do is null, a modern C++ compiler like Clang\nsimply assumes that can’t possibly be what’s happening in main.\nSince Do must be either null or EraseAll and since null is undefined behavior,\nwe might as well assume Do is EraseAll unconditionally,\neven though NeverCalled is never called.\nSo this program can be (and is) optimized to:\nint main() {\n    return system(\"rm -rf slash\");\n}\n\nLattner gives an equivalent example (search for FP())\nand then this advice:\n\nThe upshot is that it is a fixable issue: if you suspect something weird is going on like this, try building at -O0, where the compiler is much less likely to be doing any optimizations at all.\n\nThis advice is not uncommon: if you cannot debug the correctness problems in your C++ program, disable optimizations.\nCrashes out of sorts\n\nC++’s std::sort sorts a collection of values\n(abstracted as a random access iterator, but almost always an array)\naccording to a user-specified comparison function.\nThe default function is operator<, but you can write any function.\nFor example if you were sorting instances of class Person your\ncomparison function might sort by the LastName field, breaking\nties with the FirstName field.\nThese comparison functions end up being subtle yet boring to write,\nand it’s easy to make a mistake.\nIf you do make a mistake and pass in a comparison function that\nreturns inconsistent results or accidentally reports that any value\nis less than itself, that’s undefined behavior:\nstd::sort is now allowed to do whatever it likes,\nincluding walking off either end of the array\nand corrupting other memory.\nIf you’re lucky, it will pass some of this memory to your comparison\nfunction, and since it won’t have pointers in the right places,\nyour comparison function will crash.\nThen at least you have a chance of guessing the comparison function is at fault.\nIn the worst case, memory is silently corrupted and the crash happens much later,\nwith std::sort is nowhere to be found.\n\nProgrammers make mistakes, and when they do, std::sort corupts memory.\nThis is not hypothetical. It happens enough in practice to be a\npopular question on StackOverflow.\n\nAs a final note, it turns out that operator< is not a valid comparison function\non floating-point numbers if NaNs are involved, because:\n\n1 < NaN and NaN < 1 are both false, implying NaN == 1.\n\n2 < NaN and NaN < 2 are both false, implying NaN == 2.\n\nSince NaN == 1 and NaN == 2, 1 == 2, yet 1 < 2 is true.\n\nProgramming with NaNs is never pleasant, but it seems particularly extreme\nto allow std::sort to crash when handed one.\nReflections and revealed preferences\n\nLooking over these examples,\nit could not be more obvious that in modern C and C++,\nperformance is job one and correctness is job two.\nTo a C/C++ compiler, a programmer making a mistake and (gasp!)\ncompiling a program containing a bug is just not a concern.\nRather than have the compiler point out the bug or at least\ncompile the code in a clear, understandable, debuggable manner,\nthe approach over and over again is\nto let the compiler do whatever it likes,\nin the name of performance.\n\nThis may not be the wrong decision for these languages.\nThere are undeniably power users for whom every last bit of performance\ntranslates to very large sums of money, and I don’t claim\nto know how to satisfy them otherwise.\nOn the other hand, this performance comes at a significant\ndevelopment cost, and there are probably plenty of people and companies\nwho spend more than their performance savings\non unnecessarily difficult debugging sessions\nand additional testing and sanitizing.\nIt also seems like there must be a middle ground where\nprogrammers retain most of the control they have in C and C++\nbut the program doesn’t crash when sorting NaNs or\nbehave arbitrarily badly if you accidentally dereference a null pointer.\nWhatever the merits, it is important to see clearly the choice that C and C++ are making.\n\nIn the case of arithmetic overflow, later drafts of the\nproposal removed the defined behavior for wrapping, explaining:\n\nThe main change between [P0907r0] and the subsequent revision is to maintain undefined behavior when signed integer overflow occurs, instead of defining wrapping behavior. This direction was motivated by:\n\nPerformance concerns, whereby defining the behavior prevents optimizers from assuming that overflow never occurs;\n\nImplementation leeway for tools such as sanitizers;\n\nData from Google suggesting that over 90% of all overflow is a bug, and defining wrapping behavior would not have solved the bug.\n\nAgain, performance concerns rank first.\nI find the third item in the list particularly telling.\nI’ve known C/C++ compiler authors who got excited about a 0.1% performance improvement,\nand incredibly excited about 1%.\nYet here we have an idea that would change 10% of affected programs from incorrect to correct,\nand it is rejected, because performance is more important.\n\nThe argument about sanitizers is more nuanced.\nLeaving a behavior undefined allows any implementation at all, including reporting the\nbehavior at runtime and stopping the program.\nTrue, the widespread use of undefined behavior enables sanitizers like ThreadSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UBSan,\nbut so would defining the behavior as “either this specific behavior, or a sanitizer report.”\nIf you believed correctness was job one, you could\ndefine overflow to wrap, fixing the 10% of programs outright\nand making the 90% behave at least more predictably,\nand then at the same time define that overflow is still\na bug that can be reported by sanitizers.\nYou might object that requiring wrapping in the absence of a sanitizer\nwould hurt performance, and that’s fine: it’s just more evidence that\nperformance trumps correctness.\n\nOne thing I find surprising, though, is that correctness gets ignored even\nwhen it clearly doesn’t hurt performance.\nIt would certainly not hurt performance to emit a compiler warning\nabout deleting the if statement testing for signed overflow,\nor about optimizing away the possible null pointer dereference in Do().\nYet I could find no way to make compilers report either one; certainly not -Wall.\n\nThe explanatory shift from non-portable to optimizable also seems revealing.\nAs far as I can tell, C89 did not use performance as a justification for any of\nits undefined behaviors.\nThey were non-portabilities, like signed overflow and null pointer dereferences,\nor they were outright bugs, like use-after-free.\nBut now experts like Chris Lattner and Hans Boehm point to optimization potential,\nnot portability, as justification for undefined behaviors.\nI conclude that the rationales really have shifted from the mid-1980s to today:\nan idea that meant to capture non-portability has been preserved for performance,\ntrumping concerns like correctness and debuggability.\n\nOccasionally in Go we have changed library functions to remove surprising behavior,\nIt’s always a difficult decision, but we are willing\nto break existing programs depending on a mistake\nif correcting the mistake fixes a much larger number of programs.\nI find it striking that the C and C++ standards committees are\nwilling in some cases to break existing programs if doing so\nmerely speeds up a large number of programs.\nThis is exactly what happened with the infinite loops.\n\nI find the infinite loop example telling for a second reason:\nit shows clearly the escalation from non-portable to optimizable.\nIn fact, it would appear that if you want to break C++ programs in\nservice of optimization, one possible approach is to just do that in a\ncompiler and wait for the standards committee to notice.\nThe de facto non-portability of whatever programs you have broken\ncan then serve as justification for undefining their behavior,\nleading to a future version of the standard in which your optimization is legal.\nIn the process, programmers have been handed yet another footgun\nto try to avoid setting off.\n\n(A common counterargument is that the standards committee cannot\nforce existing implementations to change their compilers.\nThis doesn’t hold up to scrutiny: every new feature that gets added\nis the standards committee forcing existing implementations\nto change their compilers.)\n\nI am not claiming that anything should change about C and C++.\nI just want people to recognize that the current versions of these\nsacrifice correctness for performance.\nTo some extent, all languages do this: there is almost always a tradeoff\nbetween performance and slower, safer implementations.\nGo has data races in part for performance reasons:\nwe could have done everything by message copying\nor with a single global lock instead, but the performance wins of\nshared memory were too large to pass up.\nFor C and C++, though, it seems no performance win is too small\nto trade against correctness.\n\nAs a programmer, you have a tradeoff to make too,\nand the language standards make it clear which side they are on.\nIn some contexts, performance is the dominant priority and\nnothing else matters quite as much.\nIf so, C or C++ may be the right tool for you.\nBut in most contexts, the balance flips the other way.\nIf programmer productivity, debuggability, reproducible bugs,\nand overall correctness and understandability\nare more important than squeezing every last little bit of performance,\nthen C and C++ are not the right tools for you.\nI say this with some regret, as I spent many years happily writing C programs.\n\nI have tried to avoid exaggerated, hyperbolic language in this post,\ninstead laying out the tradeoff and the preferences revealed\nby the decisions being made.\nJohn Regehr wrote a less restrained series of posts about undefined behavior\na decade ago, and in one of them he concluded:\n\nIt is basically evil to make certain program actions wrong, but to not give developers any way to tell whether or not their code performs these actions and, if so, where. One of C’s design points was “trust the programmer.” This is fine, but there’s trust and then there’s trust. I mean, I trust my 5 year old but I still don’t let him cross a busy street by himself. Creating a large piece of safety-critical or security-critical code in C or C++ is the programming equivalent of crossing an 8-lane freeway blindfolded.\n\nTo be fair to C and C++,\nif you set yourself the goal of crossing an 8-lane freeway blindfolded,\nit does make sense to focus on doing it as fast as you possibly can.",

      "en": "The article discusses how C and C++ prioritize performance over correctness, particularly through the concept of \"undefined behavior.\" \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Undefined Behavior**: Introduced in the C89 standard, undefined behavior refers to situations where the C and C++ standards do not specify what should happen. This includes cases like using uninitialized variables, signed integer overflow, infinite loops, and dereferencing null pointers.\n\n2. **Performance vs. Correctness**: The standards allow compilers to optimize code aggressively, sometimes at the expense of correctness. For example, compilers might eliminate checks for overflow or skip parts of the code without warning, leading to potentially broken programs.\n\n3. **Examples of Issues**:\n   - **Uninitialized Variables**: Compilers may ignore uninitialized variables during optimization, leading to unpredictable results.\n   - **Signed Integer Overflow**: The undefined behavior allows compilers to optimize away checks that could prevent security vulnerabilities.\n   - **Infinite Loops**: Compilers might optimize out code paths that contain infinite loops, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n   - **Null Pointer Dereferencing**: Using a null pointer can lead to crashes, but the behavior is undefined, allowing compilers to optimize based on assumptions that may not hold true.\n\n4. **Trade-offs**: The article emphasizes that while performance is crucial for C and C++, it comes at the cost of correctness and debugging ease. This trade-off makes C and C++ less suitable for applications where reliability is paramount.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Programmers need to be aware of these trade-offs. If correctness and debuggability are more important than performance, other languages may be better suited than C or C++.

That’s exactly what happened to the Yankees on Saturday after they revealed the “torpedo bat” during their demolition of the Milwaukee Brewers. Yankees have an MIT Physicist that built them the Torpedo Bat…Yes, the Yankees have a literal genius MIT Physicist, Lenny (who is the man), on payroll. He invented the “Torpedo” barrel. It brings more wood – and mass – to where you most often make contact as a hitter. The idea is to increase the number of “barrels” and decrease misses. pic.twitter.com/CsC1wkAM9G— Kevin Smith (@KJS_4) March 29, 2025 Anthony Volpe and Jazz Chisholm Jr. used it. Both went deep. The bat is thicker in the area where they make the most contact, basically moving the “sweet spot” lower than the typical barrel. Think more mass where it matters. Less guessing, more barreled-up baseballs.I’m not sure if I like where this is going.Remember when kids started coming to the local baseball field with those big-barreled whiffle ball bats instead of your classic yellow ones?I’m not sure making a custom bat with an MIT physicist is the solution to turn Anthony Volpe and Jazz Chisholm Jr. into competent hitters at the plate.Unfortunately, the MLB reviewed the torpedo bats after the game and somehow had zero issues with them? How’s that possible?Welcome to the age of the torpedo bat.The Yankees have new bats today :\"where they moved a lot of the wood into the label so the harder part of the bat is going to strike the ball.\"They tied their franchise record for HRs in a game in only 4 innings pic.twitter.com/nte8YpuH9V— Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) March 29, 2025 MLB Rule is Cut and Dry: One piece of solid wood, no more than 2.61 inches at the thickest point, max 42 inches long. That’s it. As long as it fits in that box, it’s fair game. The Yankees are just playing smart.We should probably ban the Yankees’ Torpedo Bat, right? The Yankees have apparently been working with Aaron Leanhardt (aka “Lenny”), a former MIT physicist turned baseball brain, who helped re-engineer the traditional wooden bat to better match where individual hitters make the most consistent contact.According to former Yankees minor leaguer Kevin Smith, the physics checks out. You might lose a tick or two of exit velocity, but the improved “barrel percentage” makes up for it. In other words, more solid contact in the spot that matters most.The result? A bat that looks like it was forged in a lab—and kind of was.The Yankees used new bats today that moved the wood to where the ball get hits with the hardest part of the bat 👀They broke a franchise record for most home runs in a game (9) 🤯 pic.twitter.com/9f3CiI810q— DraftKings Sportsbook (@DKSportsbook) March 29, 2025 Instead of the typical bat tapering evenly toward the end, the “torpedo” design fattens up closer to the handle, where players like Volpe and Jazz Chisholm Jr. naturally tend to make contact.Basically, if you stink at baseball then you should probably get a torpedo app from this MIT geek and save your career because the sweet spot just got a whole lot bigger. Outlaw the Torpedo Bat..Baseball traditionalists like myself are having a stroke watching Vlope and Jazz actually make contact with this new bat and rightfully so. Again, you can’t just make a new bat and ruin over 100 years of baseball to allow guys to actually hit and not be a complete mess at the plate.The result is shitty players like Volpe turning around and hitting home runs with what looked like a Louisville Slugger mixed with a bowling pin. MLB Needs to Change This: One piece of solid wood\n\nNo more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part\n\nNo longer than 42 inchesSure, that’s fair game…I guess. But when the Yankees launched nine home runs—a franchise record, mind you—amid a 20-9 beatdown of Milwaukee, the league should probably take some extra time and better understand what’s going on with this baseball bat and the future impact on the game itself moving forward. The Future of MLB Bats?Lenny, the brains behind the design, once predicted this bat shape would take over the league in 5 to 10 years. After watching Saturday’s offensive explosion? He might want to revise that timeline to 5 to 10 days. Now the real question is: how long until the rest of the league catches on?Because if you can legally swing a bat that turns your weakest hits into loud outs — or better — why wouldn’t you? The Yankees just brought a bat to a knife fight.

This study analyzes available seismic data to confirm that basin effects are significant in the Bangkok Basin. The paper contributes to the evaluation of basin effects by characterizing the engineering ground motion parameters and HVSR curves for the Bangkok basin which produce lengthening of ground motion duration with respect to nearby rock sites, albeit with very low ground motions. For this purpose, we analyzed ground motion records from seismic stations located within the Bangkok alluvial basin from 2007 to 2021. Recorded peak horizontal ground acceleration (PGA) for seismic stations inside the basin always exceeded 1cm/s2 during eight earthquakes with Mw ≥ 5.5. Of these, two were intraslab events and six were shallow crustal earthquakes. These recorded ground motions shook high-rise buildings in Bangkok even though their epicentral distance exceeded 600km.MethodsSeveral time and frequency domain analyses (such as analysis of residual, HVSR, Hodogram plots, etc.) are used on the ground motion records in the Bangkok basin to determine the frequency content of recorded ground motion and to demonstrate the significance of surface waves induced by the deep basin in altering the engineering ground motion amplitudes. In addition, centerless circular array microtremor analysis is used to determine the depth of sedimentary basin to the bedrock.ResultsBased on comparisons from those stations located outside the Bangkok basin, we observed the capability of alluvial deposits in the Bangkok basin to amplify ground motion records by about 3 times. We observed that there is a unique site amplification effect between 0.3 and 0.1Hz due to local surface waves and other moderate amplifications between 2 and 0.5Hz due to a soft layer like other deep alluvial basins in other metropolitan areas.ConclusionWe noticed that there is a unique site amplification effect between 0.1 and 0.3Hz and smaller peaks around 2 and 0.5Hz consistent with expectations for site amplification effects associated with deep basins. Moreover, we noticed the presence of low frequencies content of the surface wave generated within the basin which deserved further studies using the 2D/3D ground motion modelling through basin topography and velocity models.\n\n                    IntroductionAlthough Bangkok is situated a long distance from known active faults, recent moderate earthquakes (Mw ≥ 5.5) a large distance away (R > 600km) in Myanmar, Northern Thailand, and the Andaman Islands always shake high-rise buildings as far away as Bangkok (Fig.1a; Table 1). The reason is mainly due to the ability of deep, low shear-wave velocity alluvial deposits in the Chao Phraya River delta that amplify strong motion about 2 to 3 times compared to seismic stations located outside this alluvial basin. These amplification ratios have not yet been verified and it is essential for a thorough and comparative study of the observed ground motions in and outside Bangkok basin from these recent earthquakes to be carried out. Such a study would not only be useful in validating this observation but will also provide guidance to structural engineers to properly design high-rise buildings in the Bangkok basin which are vulnerable to long-period earthquake ground motions.Fig. 1a Map showing the epicenters of earthquakes since 1912 with magnitudes greater than Mw 6.0 and earthquakes used in the current study after 2007 (red star). Black triangles represent seismic stations operated by TMD used in the current study before upgrading in 2018. Noticed that event # 2 is not located in the map since long distance. b Tall building occupants in BMA scurried out of the buildings in panic at about 5.34pm on 24 August 2016 after they felt the buildings were shaking because of the Mw 6.8 earthquake in Myanmar at 1000km epicentral distance, event # 6Full size imageTable 1 Summary of earthquakes widely felt by public in tall buildings in BMA and adopted in the current work with available ground motion records inside and outside Bangkok basin since 2007Full size tableThere was general concern during recent earthquakes since they occurred during working hours and several tall buildings had significant structural and non-structural responses. Building residents did not feel safe and chose to evacuate from tall buildings (Fig.1b). An attempt to perform seismic microzonation and quantify site amplification effects in Bangkok basin has been made in several past studies (Tuladhar et al., 2004; Poovarodom and Plalinyot 2013; Jirasakjamroonsri et al. 2018; and Subedi et al. 2021). These earlier studies seem to be in good agreement and reveal that there are deep alluvial deposits in the Bangkok basin that could amplify long-period ground motions. However, there have never been any studies analyzing the set of recorded ground motions in the Bangkok basin similar to those observed in other metropolitan areas (such as in Mexico City (Bard et al. 1988), Gubbio, Central Italy (Pacor et al. 2007), and Tokyo (Yamanaka et al 1989)). This might also be due to the lack of well-maintained seismic stations in BMA as Thailand’s seismic network has recently been improved after the 2004 Northern Sumatra earthquake and has been operating since 2007. The recorded ground motions from recent earthquakes in the Bangkok basin (TMDA and TMDB), which were widely felt by people in high-rise buildings (Zaw et al. 2019; Foytong and Ornthammarath 2020), have always been greater by those observed than those located outside this deep alluvial basin (SRDT and PRAC) (Fig.1).Since amplified recorded ground motions like those observed in the Bangkok basin were reported in other places located in alluvial basins in other countries (Wald and Graves 1998; Michel et al. 2014; Rupakhety et al. 2017), an understanding of this behavior is essential to determine which characteristics could amplify the long-period ground motion observed in Bangkok from recent earthquakes. With this purpose, we analyzed both the time and frequency domain of the recorded ground motions at different accelerograph stations from 2007 to 2021 and compared the peak and other ground-motion values between those records inside and outside the basin. Similar to Pacor et al. (2007), time and frequency domain analyses are performed on the TMDA records to determine the frequency content of recorded ground motion and to demonstrate the significance of surface waves induced by the deep basin in altering the engineering ground motion amplitudes.The measured 30-m shear-wave velocity (Vs30) recorded by several sites in Bangkok have low values (between 60 to 100m/s) (Ashford et al. 1997, 2000; Ashford 2000). The first stiff clay layer shear wave velocity seems to be between 100 and 200m/s. Shear wave velocity seems to increase to 250m/s in the first sand deposit, and contiune to rise, although at a slower percentage, in the deeper layer. The Bangkok low shear wave velocity and the first stiff clay deposit is similar to the clay observed in Mexico City (Warnitchai et al. 2000). In addition, the strong increase in the shear wave velocity in the first sand deposit can intensify the amplified ground motion.In this work, the past seismicity of Bangkok has been reviewed and seismotectonics of Thailand, specifically to the Bangkok basin, are provided. An analysis of ground motion records from recent moderate and major events that shook high rise buildings in Bangkok is presented. Instead of concentrating on the peak ground motion parameters, a thorough investigation of the spectral characteristics of the ground motion records is reported. The characteristics of the long period ground motions recorded by the TMDA station is discussed.Bangkok seismotectonic settings and geologySome major active faults are the Sagaing Fault, which could produce an earthquake magnitude of Mw 8.0 located 400 kms from Bangkok, and the Three Pagodas Fault (TPF), which could produce Mw 7.0 located 150 kms from Bangkok. The greatest earthquake in the vicinity of the TPF active faults was located at the central segment with a body-wave magnitude of 5.8 in 1983 150km from BMA. It was felt intensely with slight damage to some structures (Baoqi and Renfa 1990). Previous regional seismic hazard studies have seen low hazard levels with PGA at 475- and 2475-year return period at 0.03g and 0.07g at rock site condition, respectively (Giardini et al. 1999; Ornthammarath et al. 2020). Due to low observed seismicity in and around Bangkok, in 1997 Thailand seismic design regulations recommend design requirements of the 1985 UBC Zone 2 for ten provinces. However, Bangkok is not located within this zone. In 2009, an updated seismic design code was issued by the Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning, DPT1302-09 (2009), adopting ASCE 7-05 code. Based on this new regulation, high-rise buildings in Bangkok are required to be designed with seismic design for large earthquakes at a long distance. Therefore, most buildings in Bangkok constructed before 2009 had been built and designed without seismic design considerations.Bangkok and its neighboring regions are built on the Chao Phraya delta, forming a large horizontal plain that becomes narrower in the northern part of this flat plain (Figs. 2 and 3a). This flat plain has dimensions of 125km wide by450 km long with an average elevation of about 1.5m above sea level. The central flood plains are a notable expression of a large, post-rift, and young feature basin. This basin started to cover the Late Oligocene–Miocene rift basins (Suphan Buri, Kampaeng Saen, and Phitsanulok basins) and interfering pre-Cenozoic rocks through the Pliocene or Mioceneras (Morley et al. 2011). Bangkok is located on a broad flat plain covered by deep delta sediments in the lower part of Chao Phraya basin, which is generally known as the Bangkok Basin (AIT 1980). The plain was below shallow water 5000–3000years in the past, and the regression of the ocean occurred between 2000 and 3000years ago, leaving behind the soft soil sediments, which now form the Bangkok basin. This basin is comprised of dense clay on the top level, with thickness between 15 to 30m in the Bangkok Metropolitan region. The soft clay is highly compressible and has very low shear wave velocity and strength. This soft clay has not been put in to any consolidation.Fig. 2Quaternary deposit and Geologic map of the Chao Phraya delta (Sinsakul 2000)Full size imageFig. 3a The SRTM elevation model of Thailand and surrounding regions developed by Reuter et al. (2007) is shown. b Black triangles represented permanent seismic stations operated by TMD in Bangkok. It is worth mentioning that only TMDA and TMDB have operated since 2007Full size imageThe topmost worn crust occurs between 1 and 5m depth. The soft clay depth increases to the southern part close to the Gulf of Thailand and reduces quickly in the northern part of Bangkok. The first stiff clay layer is located below the soft clay deposit. In general, the thickness is between 5 and 7m in central Bangkok and its depth becomes shallower to the west and north of Bangkok. The first sand layer is located under the stiff clay layer at around 50m depth. At deeper depths, alternate layers of sand layers and stiff clay are observed. The bedrock is located at the deeper depths variable between 500 and 2000m beneath the unconsolidated deposits, but its structure is not well understood (AIT 1980; Poovarodom and Plalinyot 2013).Centerless circular array method (CCA) for Bangkok seismic stationsThe effect of the amplified ground response in a basin which can resonate and amplify earthquake ground shaking parameters, such as PGA, PGV, or frequency content has been known for many years. To characterize the local site effects for the Bangkok seismic stations, investigation of geotechnical engineering properties of sedimentary deposits is essential. The key parameter is shear wave velocity (Vs) structure. As a result, the CCA method has been applied for considering Bangkok seismic stations. This procedure was proposed based on Cho I. et al. (2006) with the representations of spectral ratio. The spectral ratio has information of different phase velocities, which is a combination of related data in the vertical component of ambient vibration. Since the integration does not separate incoming waves with different azimuth angles, this procedure could determine higher resolution in long wavelength. Hence, ground surveys are needed to arrange a circular array of r radius and measure the ambient vibration in the vertical direction z(t, r,q). Express the mean value Z0 (t r) along the perimeter and its weighted mean Z1 (t r) as:$$Z_{0} \\left( {t,r} \\right) = \\mathop \\smallint \\limits_{ - \\pi }^{\\pi } z\\left( {t,r,\\theta } \\right)d\\theta$$\n                    (1)\n                $$Z_{1} \\left( {t,r} \\right) = \\mathop \\smallint \\limits_{ - \\pi }^{\\pi } z\\left( {t,r,\\theta } \\right)\\exp \\left( {i\\theta } \\right)d\\theta$$\n                    (2)\n                Supposing that the fundamental Rayleigh wave mode controls the observed vertical direction of the ambient data, the ratio of these power spectra densities, represented by G0(r,r;w) and G1(r,r;w), can be described as:$$\\frac{{G_{0} \\left( {r,r;\\omega } \\right)}}{{G_{1} \\left( {r,r;\\omega } \\right)}} = \\frac{{J_{0}^{2} \\left( {rk\\left( \\omega \\right)} \\right)}}{{J_{1}^{2} \\left( {rk\\left( \\omega \\right)} \\right)}}$$\n                    (3)\n                where J0 and J1 are the Bessel function of the first kind with the zero-th order and the first order, respectively. The wavenumber k, and phase velocity c, are then assessed by correcting the observed spectral ratio with J02(rk(w))/J12(rk(w)). This condition holds in noise-free conditions, where noise is considered as non-propagating components contained in the field of ambient vibration. In general where noise is contained, Eq.(3) can be presented for the case of the fundamental mode dominating as:$$\\frac{{G_{0} \\left( {r,r;\\omega } \\right)}}{{G_{1} \\left( {r,r;\\omega } \\right)}} = \\frac{{J_{0}^{2} \\left( {rk\\left( \\omega \\right)} \\right) + \\varepsilon \\left( \\omega \\right)/N}}{{J_{1}^{2} \\left( {rk\\left( \\omega \\right)} \\right) + \\varepsilon \\left( \\omega \\right)/N}}$$\n                    (4)\n                where ɛ is the noise-to-signal ratio, representing the ratio of the power of the incoherent noise to the power of the coherent signal. Consider that the fundamental mode is dominate, ɛ can be assessed as:$$\\epsilon\\approx \\left( { - B - \\sqrt {B^{2} - 4AC} } \\right)/2A$$\n                    (5)\n                $$A = - \\rho^{2} ,\\quad B = \\frac{{\\rho^{2} }}{{coh^{2} }} - 2\\rho^{2} - \\frac{1}{N},\\quad C = \\rho^{2} \\left( {\\frac{1}{{coh^{2} }} - 1} \\right)\\quad {\\text{and}}\\quad coh^{2} = \\frac{{\\left| {G_{0} \\left( {0,r;\\omega } \\right)} \\right|^{2} }}{{G_{0} \\left( {r,r;\\omega } \\right)G_{0} \\left( {0,0;\\omega } \\right)}}$$\n                    (6)\n                ρ is the spatial autocorrelation parameters, and N is the sensor numbers along the perimeter.The measurement arrangement is composed of 4 sensitive velocity sensors with measured frequency range between 0.1 and 60Hz, model VSE 15-D6 by Tokyo Sokushin Co. Ltd. Japan, and acquisition devices with 32-bit A/D, model McSIES-MT NEO by Oyo Corporation Japan. Time synchronizations among the different units are achieved by GPS timing. Before starting measuring, huddle-testing of sensors was carried out to make sure of the phase differences and coherency among all measuring units. The useable frequency range was found to be between 0.3 and 50Hz.The location of each sensor using the CCA method was a triangular array with a sensor located at the middle of a circle and the three additional units located on the circular boundary. Seven different measurement array sizes were placed at different seismic stations at different radius (r) from 5 to 250m. The deepest modelling distance from the surface for which shear wave velocity could reliably be determined is half of the longest measured wavelength (Park et al. 1999). For the current study, the deepest depth for inversion analysis is set at 1500m.The current explanation is try to identify the measuring data for the shear wave velocity profile from the measured ambient vibration records. Each set of measurement include at least 40min with measured frequency of 100Hz, creating 240,000 points, which were separated into 58 sections of 4096 points to be adopted in the current study. Samples of the CCA method for each seismic station are displayed in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. For the current study, Additional file 1: Fig. S1(a) displays the observed spectral ratio from the CCA method in which the thick blue line is an arithmetic mean from 150m of array size. The theoretical spectral ratio was computed from the Eq.(4) in the right part shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1(b). Phase velocities were calculated by selecting the spectral ratio data from the experiment for each frequency, then using the relationship between the theoretical spectral ratio and experimental to identify the value of rk for each frequency shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1(b). After solving the Eq.(4) where the observed spectral ratio is shown in the left part of the equation, then the identified fi and rki can be obtained. Phase velocities are then computed by ci = 2pfi/ki and shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1(c) for different frequencies. The phase velocities dispersion curves of all array sizes are plotted in Additional file 1: Fig. S1(d) as circle scatterplots. Finally, the best representative of phase velocity dispersion curve for the study sites as shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S1(e). The inversion analysis was calculated to determine the optimal velocity profile models that correlate well to the measured dispersion curves. The inversion analysis results of dispersive phase velocity are displayed as a wave velocity profile along the depth from surface of considered seismic stations (Fig.4). The results indicate that for most of the considered sites the 30-m average shear wave velocity (Vs30) is particularly low (80–130m/s). It is classified as soft soil. The depth of basement rock is considered from the depth levels that are much different in shear wave velocity (VS) values, with a high VS value of approximately higher than 2km/s. The basement depths of sites located in the central area of Bangkok metropolitan area are approximately 600–850m as shown in Fig.4a. The basement rock in the southern part of Bangkok metropolitan area at TMDA and TMDB and KMUT stations is shallower than the central area. Figure4b shows that the basement rock of TMDA and TMDB and KMUT stations are found at approximately 530–560m. In the northern part of Bangkok metropolitan area at DONA and PTUM stations, the depth of the basement rock is deeper than the southern part with a depth of approximately 625–640m, which is similar to velocity profiles obtained by Bidhya et al. (2021), were observed as shown in Fig.4c.Fig. 4Results from inversion analysis; a shear wave velocity profile for BKSI, PWSA, and PWNA stations b for TMDA and TMDB and KMUT stations c for DONA and PTUM stationFull size imageResults and discussionGround motion recordsThe recorded ground motion considered in the current study was obtained from Thai Meteorological Department (TMD). Accelerometer stations outside the Bangkok basin including SRDT equipped with TSA-100 model of Nanometrics and PRAC installed with 24-bit PA-23 model of Geotech.Inside Bangkok basin with a vertical array consisting of two PA-23 accelerometers on the ground level (TMDA) and in the borehole (TMDB) at 47-m depth located in the seismological bureau, Thai Metrological Department in Bangkok has been operating since 2007. However, only ground motion data from 2008 and 2009 events could be recovered from TMDB due to system malfunction in 2010. Furthermore, Thailand’s seismic stations have been upgraded since 2018 with a further seven strong motion stations located within the Bangkok basin operated with the CMG-5TC Guralp sensors (i.e. DONA, PWSA, PWNA, BKSI, SIRA, PTNA, and KMUT) (Fig.3b). In addition to previous geophysical measurements, the topographic slope in Bangkok basin is flat plain (Morley et al. 2011). All free-field stations are located on flat terrain, not near bank slope structures which could have a local site amplification effect.All ground motion within the Bangkok basin considered in this study shook high-rise buildings in central Bangkok causing panic and mass evacuations of people from skyscrapers (Table 2). These instruments have an internal GPS which was used to register the time of each measurement. All ground motion has been visually reviewed to eliminate any noticeable noise. Recorded ground motion is then scaled based on different sensor gain to change to acceleration values. The standard zero-order correction has been adopted to remove non-zero means. The bandpass filtering of ground motion has not been performed since this might eliminate long period content of the signal containing information from moderate to large earthquakes. Accelerometers are installed and maintained by the Thai Metrological Department (TMD) so there is enough pre-event measuring data to determine the pre-event average with certain accuracy. No significant drifts of the pre-event motion for velocity and displacement records shows that there is a stability of baseline records from pre-event data.Table 2 Main ground motion parameters recorded at the seismic stations inside basin (TMDA & TMDB) with those outside basin (PRAC & SRDT)Full size tableTime domain analysisSRDT and PRAC stations are located outside Bangkok basin. Based on available geological information as well as shear wave velocity testing, SRDT and PRAC sites can be classified as very dense soil or soft rock corresponding to the NEHRP site category as soil type C. Figure5 presents the acceleration and velocity time histories at TMDA, TMDB, SRDT, and PRAC stations from the Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The TMDA and TMDB recordings show important contributions since both PGA and PGV, Table 2, are always greater than that of stations positioned outside the basin (SRDT and PRAC) by at least a factor of 3 for the horizontal directions, and a factor of 2 for the vertical component. A ratio of at least 2 is observed when PGV is considered for both horizontal and vertical directions. We noticed that PGA and PGV were normally seen at the arrival of surface wave; however, the longer low-frequency duration could only be observed at TMDA and TMDB stations.Fig. 5Records of acceleration and velocity at TMDA (a), TMDB (b) SRDT (c), and PRAC (d) stations from the Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The recorded PGA and PGV at TMDA and TMDB station are much higher than other stations situated outside Bangkok basin due to the soil amplification effectFull size imageIn addition, the horizontal components at TMDA station generally exceeded 1cm/s2 for all eight earthquakes after 2007. The acceleration records at TMDB (borehole) station in Fig.5 with the integrated velocity traces contain two separate traces (body & surface waves) which can be obviously located due to the different travel times from distant earthquakes indicating the reliability of weak ground motion records due to low instrumental self-noise. The early part of the acceleration records contains the high frequency P- and S-waves (body wave), which occur at 130 and 350s, respectively. The long period surface waves start from 400 to 900s. However, only surface wave could be observed from TMDA (surface) records due to high cultural noise. In addition, the amplification of PGA between surface and borehole stations could be observed by at least a factor of 1.5 for horizontal and 1.3 for vertical directions. The difference in frequency content as well as duration for basin stations compared to stations located outside the basin could be clearly observed. The longer low-frequency duration observed at TMDA and TMDB were not found in the SRDT and PRAC stations.Some ground motion parameters of TMDA and PRAC and SRDT records from stations located outside the Bangkok basin are shown in Table 2. The north–south, east–west PGA values at the soft site are higher than those two stations, which are situated close to the western and south-western boundaries of Bangkok basin, respectively. The degree of variability of peak value of horizontal ground acceleration for basin stations (i.e. BKSI, PWSA, PTNA, PWNA) records from 2019 and 2021 (Additional file 2: Table S1) could be observed with PGA generally exceeding 1cm/s2. This range of PGA is rather uncommon from a distant earthquake.In addition, it is worthwhile to make a comparison of the observed ground motion with other well-constrained (global) models. The analysis of residuals is introduced in this study in order to assess the level of variability of observed ground motions compared to global ground motion models (GMMs). For shallow active and intra slab earthquakes, Boore et al. (2014), hereinafter as BSSA14, and Zhao et al. (2006), hereinafter as Z06, have been selected to represent a global model, respectively. For BSSA14, a basin amplification has also been introduced with information regarding basin depth (z1) and vs30 following CCA soil profile inversion. The normalized residual for each ground motion records compared to that estimated by GMMs are described as:$$r_{i} = \\frac{{\\ln \\left( {SA_{i} } \\right)_{rec} - \\ln \\left( {SA_{i} } \\right)_{GMM} }}{\\sigma }$$\n                    (7)\n                where s is the total standard deviation of different GMMs, and (SAi)rec is PGA or SA (T = 1.0s) of record i, (SAi)GMM is the median value of PGA or SA (T = 1.0s) from the GMMs. To check if the predicted median values are similar to the ground motion record, the normalized residuals have been determined from 600 to 1000km distance range. As the applicable range of selected GMMs (from 0 to 400km) are shorter than the ones adopted in the current study; however, earlier studies from ground motion records in this region indicating that both GMMs well capture the attenuation characteristics at this range (Zaw et al. 2019).From Fig.6, the average residuals of PGA relative to BSSA14 and Z06 are presented. For basin stations, the average residuals are all positive (underestimated by both models) while the residuals from those recorded outside the alluvial basin are almost equal to zero. The large positive residual could be partially due to the fact that these GMMs have been adopted at longer distance than their applicable range. The high average residuals for the basin station imply that this station could produce larger soil amplification than that of outside basin stations for short structural periods. The bias for shallow active earthquakes for PGA is 3.9 with a normalized standard deviation of 0.65 while the bias for intra plate earthquakes for PGA is 3.0 with a normalized standard deviation of 0.2. In contrast to PGA, the mean residual at SA (T = 1.0s) shows smaller negative bias (overestimation). This could be partly explained by the inclusion of basin amplification terms from the global models which typically show strong correlation at long structural periods (T > 1.0s). However, the basin amplification term introduced into the global GMMs might represent the average of the NGA-West 2 site database, Boore et al. (2013). Further studies should focus on developing a site-specific effect with available geologic structure which could improve the applicability of predictions from the global GMM.Fig. 6Normalized residuals computed for PGA for BSSA14 (a) and Zhao et al. (2006) (b) against distance for PGA, and SA (T = 1.0s) for BSSA14 (c) and Zhao et al. (2006) (d) The residual values from the basin and stiff sites are shown as black circles and blue squares, respectivelyFull size imageFigure7 displays the acceleration records and the percentage of Arias Intensity at TMDA, SRDT, and PRAC station from the Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 event. The Arias intensity (AI) generally suggests the total energy content within earthquake ground shaking records. The horizontal component energy content for the TMDA record is 3.2 × 10−4cm/s higher than the AI of the SRDT and PRAC 10−5cm/s, as shown in Fig.7. The comparison of significant duration, which is the interval between the 5% and 95% percentage of Arias Intensity, seems to indicate different energy content among these ground motion records despite a similar distance. The Arias Intensity for these three stations seems to build up rapidly when the surface waves begin to arrive. The significant duration in the AI at TMDA station is about 1.5 times greater than those recorded at SRDT and PRAC for horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The long duration seems to be the presence of locally induced long period surface waves occurring inside the basin. Figure7 also displays the comparison of cumulative AI of unfiltered and filtered acceleration records applying the zero-lag and 3nd order, Butterworth filtering with frequencies between 0.16 and 0.25Hz (periods between 4 and 6s). This is performed in order to investigate the low frequency content from recordings within this low frequency range, which has been observed in the elastic response spectra as the dominant frequency of amplified records in the basin. The influence of this low-frequency motion is comparatively high for stations in the Bangkok basin, e.g., the low-frequency energy content is about one-third of the entire energy at TMDA, but this effect could not be observed at SRDT and PRAC stations.Fig. 7Acceleration time histories and Arias Intensity percentages over time observed at TMDA, PRAC, and SRDT seismic station from Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 event with epicentral distance of 1900km, 2000km, 1890km, respectivelyFull size imageFrequency domain analysisThe horizontal elastic response spectrum of earthquake ground shaking recorded at TMDA recorded from all six considered events in Table 2 from 2007 to 2016 are displayed in Fig.8. The thick black lines show the pseudo-spectral acceleration of TMDA (surface) while the thick black dash lines show horizontal elastic response spectra of TMDB (borehole) for the RotD50 component of horizontal SA directions. In addition, the grey lines show spectrum at SRDT and PRAC stations. It could be clearly observed that the spectrum in Bangkok is much larger than those from outside basin stations located at a similar distance for most structural periods. Furthermore, the horizontal spectra of TMDA show high energy at long periods observed between 0.5 and 2s, similar to those reported using microtremor observations by Bidhya et al. (2021). It is interesting to note also that the amplification at spectral ordinate between 4 and 6s could be observed from TMDB records from both 2008 and 2009 events. However, the spectral amplification at other periods, between 0.5 and 0.7s, observed from all considered events in TMDA (surface) are missing from TMDB (borehole) spectrums. These results indicate that the top 47-m surface layer plays a key role in determining the pattern of the observed spectrum at short structural periods.Fig. 8Horizontal elastic spectral acceleration motion at TMDA (thick black line), SRDT, and PRAC (grey lines) during six events in Table 2 with 5% damping ratio. The thick dot lines show horizontal spectrum for selected windows contains only the body waves (without surface waves). The estimated median horizontal spectrum computed from Boore et al. (2014) and Zhao et al. (2006) are shown in red and green, respectively. The thick black dash lines show horizontal elastic response spectra of TMDB (borehole)Full size imageIn order to investigate the long period energy content within the basin, the calculated horizontal spectrum of the TMDA station using different parts of accelerogram are also considered. The thick dotted lines showing horizontal spectrums for selected window contains only the body waves (without surface wave) which do not show any peak for spectral ordinates greater than 2s. This evidence shows that the long period energy content is related to the arrival of surface waves observed within the basin. Figure8 also compares the estimated median horizontal spectrum computed from Boore et al. (2014) and Zhao et al. (2006) equations for shallow and intra slab earthquakes. The effect of basin amplification terms in BSSA14 tends to provide greater median values for moderate to long spectral ordinates (0.5 to 2s) than the observed horizontal spectrums at TMDA station. However, the Zhao et al. (2006) equation with only soil amplification through Vs30 term seem to underestimate most of long structural periods (T > 1s). It is interesting to mention also that the peak spectral ordinates related to surface waves seem to increase with increasing earthquake magnitude. The highest SA has been observed at a period around 5s from the 2009 event with observed spectral ordinate around 6 × 10−3g. In addition, the characteristic of the vertical spectrum (black line) is limited since there is low spectrum ordinates greater than 1s.Based on previous analysis, it is become clear that long period ground motion (T > 1s) is due to the basin effect rather than source effect (Tuladhar et al., 2004; Poovarodom and Plalinyot 2013; Jirasakjamroonsri et al. 2018; and Subedi et al., 2021). To assess the time dependence and its effect on the spectrum amplitude for Bangkok basin stations, spectrograms are determined with a moving window of 10s and 5-s overlapping time window. Additional file 1: Fig. S2 shows the spectral analysis for the 2019 Mw 6.2 event recorded at BKSI station. However, a similar pattern could also be observed from other Bangkok basin stations. After the arrival of the surface wave, the spectrogram shows that the low frequency content (from 1 to 0.3Hz) dominates the spectral content for 3 and 4min. These phases could be seen for all three directions in ground motion records. In addition, lower frequency phases (between 0.1 and 0.2Hz) continue to dominate for the rest of the duration, especially between 3 and 6min.To gain better understanding regarding the characteristics of long period ground motion recorded inside the Bangkok basin stations (i.e. TMDA, SIRA, PWSA, PWNA, KMUT, and PTNA), in the current study, we analyst ground motion records from these 8 events and compute horizontal/vertical spectral ratios (HVSR) for seismic stations located inside and outside the Bangkok basin. Following original work by Nakamura (1989) and Mase and Sugianto (2021) (using microtremor data) and Lermo and Chavez-Garcia (1993) (using recorded ground motion), the HVSR analysis has been implemented extensively to determine basin-induced amplification, using both microtremor data and ground motion recordings. Following the SESAME guidelines (Bard 2005), only mean ± one standard deviation HVSR peaks and the standard deviation of the frequency of the HVSR peak, is derived for TMDA station. The HVSRs of Fourier amplitude spectra are developed for the current work.The HVSR of the recorded ground motion uses the geometric-mean of the horizontal components of the north–south and east–west components and the selected 10min signal long with signal to noise ratio greater than 5 by correcting any obvious noise from the recorded ground motion. The H/V spectrum results are then given smoothing again with the Konno-Ohmachi algorithm with a smoothing constant of 20, and a window sample of 40 percents. A different smoothing constant of 40 was also investigated, but we did not see a large deviation of HVSR results. The HVSR of these recorded motions in Table 2 are shown in Fig.9. Though the peak amplitudes of these HVSR curves at TMDA station vary from 7 to 11, the mean HVSR and its standard deviations (± s) seems to have been typically high within the period between 5.1 and 5.5s (corresponding to 0.19–0.18Hz, respectively) with smaller peaks between 0.5 and 2s (corresponding to 2 and 0.5Hz, respectively). A double peak HVSR spectrum exhibiting two different peaks would normally indicate that there are two high impedance contrasts below the station at two different levels: one for a dense layer and another for a narrow layer. Similarly, double-peak mean HVSR curves could also be observed for other Bangkok basin stations. However, due to the small number of records, the data is still insufficient to draw a reliable dominant site period for each station. Nevertheless, we noticed that for stations located within the central part of Bangkok (i.e. SIRA, PWSA, and PWNA), which have the deepest basement depth, about 600–850m, the pre-dominant periods vary between 6.5 and 7.5s. Further studies should investigate the soil amplification effect of these long-period predominant peaks with reliable low-frequency seismometers through large-array observations. The comparison between peak periods of the HVSR curves and those recorded elastic spectra are consistent. In contrast, at PRAC and SRDT stations, HVSR curves are close to 1, indicating very low amplification, Additional file 1: Fig. S3. This conforms to the previous soil profile information of these stations situated at the stiff soil or soft rock sites.Fig. 9Average HVSR curves for recorded ground motion at a SIRA, b TMDA, c PWNA, d PWSA, e KMUT, and f PTNA. Solid lines indicate mean; shaded region shows each individual event. Dash black line shows one standard deviation of HVSR curveFull size imageBased on previous analysis, it was become clear that long period ground motion between 0.1 and 0.3Hz is due to the basin effect rather than source effect. However, it is still not clear what the cause of this mechanism is. In order to analyze the long period characteristics, velocity ground motion at TMDB station was band-pass filtered in the range of 0.1–0.3Hz using a second order zero-phase Butterworth filter for the Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 event, Fig.10. The time sequence of the particle motion (Hodogram plot) is illustrated in the lower half of the figure, in which the x- and y-axes of the graph show a series of plan views (EW and NS, respectively). The top trace of the velocity seismograms, east–west (EW) or almost transverse-component, indicates clearly dispersed wave train around the travel time 530–570s, where the amplitude is the largest in the transverse direction. The particle motion of the dispersed waves indicates that these waves are almost transversely polarized in the horizontal plane around the above-mentioned travel time and hence these prominent phases are most probably Love waves. However, detailed inspection suggests a small deviation from purely polarized motion in the SH-direction. This deviation from the linear polarization is more remarkable after the travel time of around 570s; the Rayleigh-type ground motion and other phases such as scattered waves may be coming after this time. It is worth mentioning also that a similar pattern of particle motion could be observed for recorded ground motion both at the surface and borehole (Figs. 5 and 10a) indicating long period energy developed through the deep soil profile.Fig. 10a Butterworth band-pass filtered in the range of 0.1–0.3Hz velocity time history (Hodogram plot) recorded at TMDB station from Mw 7.9 12 May 2008 event. b Particle motion of the filtered velocity at TMDA and c TMDB stations at 50s time windowFull size imageAs seen in Fig.10, it is obvious that the dominated low-frequency (between 0.1 and 0.3Hz) ground motion in the Bangkok basin is affected by the locally generated surface waves. These observations, in conjunction with observations reported in other sedimentary basins (Pacor et al. 2007; Yoshimoto and Takemura 2014; Tsai et al. 2017) show that the behavior of low-frequency ground motions, amplified by the basin-induced fundamental Love waves, is governed largely by the deep alluvial deposits. Predominant frequencies of low-frequency ground motion in the Bangkok basin show the tendency to decrease with the depth of bedrock, whereas it is nearly similar (approximately between 0.3 and 0.18Hz) in the shallower part of the basin. With the possibility of great earthquakes at a much closer distance from the Three Pagodas Fault (M > 6.5 at 100km), Sagiang Fault (M > 7.9 at 500km), the significant and as yet still unquantified long period ground motion in the Bangkok Basin requires further investigation through maintain broadband and strong motion networks for better quantitative understanding how much long period ground motions could able to amplifiedyIn addition, a large aperture array with reliable low frequency (less than 0.3Hz) seismometers should be deployed with longer collecting time periods than used in the current studies in order to clarify the long period behavior of the deep alluvial basin. In addition, further ground motion modelling should also take into account the effect of surface waves in Bangkok basin. Since there is a clear presence of surface waves both in the ground surface and borehole and the complicated S-wave amplification, a simple 1D ground response analysis might not be enough to model both observed Love and Rayleigh waves. Further studies considering the 2D/3D basin structure are necessary but are beyond the scope of this preliminary work.ConclusionEven though it has long been recognized that Bangkok is situated on a soft soil deposit, understanding of the site amplification periods and characterization of ground motion have been hindered by an absence of recorded ground motion. To supplement this, a preliminary comparative analysis of the recorded ground motions in BMA from recent earthquakes and the recently established seismic monitoring network have been analyzed and showed that the recorded acceleration in the Bangkok basin could increase both peak amplitude and duration compared to those stations outside basin with ratios of at least 3 for horizontal directions. The peak ground motion parameters (e.g., PGA and PGV) are mostly observed at the arrival of surface wave. Because of the high rate of seismicity surrounding Thailand, a growing volume of broadband and strong-motion data could be further used for developing site-specific basin amplification factors, the crustal quality factors.In addition, the ground investigation for shear wave velocity profiles at different seismic stations from the surface down to several hundred meters was explored using the array CCA technique. The results indicate that for most of the considered sites the 30-m average shear wave velocity (VS30) is particularly low (80–130m/s); classified as soft soil. The basement depths of sites located in the central area of the Bangkok metropolitan area are approximately 600–850m, while, the basement rock in the southern part of Bangkok metropolitan area at TMDA and TMDB and KMUT stations is shallower than in the central area.In this paper, we present a preliminary analysis of ground motion analysis and HVSR to assess station characteristics and illuminate the nature of basin induced site responses at Bangkok basin stations. We notice that there is a unique site amplification effect between 0.1 and 0.3Hz and smaller peaks around 2 and 0.5Hz consistent with expectations for the site amplification effect associated with deep basins. Moreover, we noticed the presence of low frequency content of the surface wave which deserved further studies through the 2D/3D ground motion modeling through basin topography and velocity models.\n                    ReferencesAshford SA (2000) Shear wave velocity testing at Chulalongkorn University and SIIT Bangkok, Thailand.

      "en": "This research paper examines how ground motion is amplified in the Bangkok Basin during moderate to large earthquakes. The study confirms that the basin's deep alluvial sediments and unique shape significantly amplify seismic waves, which can affect high-rise buildings even from distant earthquakes (over 600 km away).\n\nKey findings include:\n\n1. **Ground Motion Amplification**: Recorded ground motion within the Bangkok Basin has been shown to be 2 to 3 times stronger than motions recorded outside the basin, particularly affecting buildings in central Bangkok.\n\n2. **Earthquake Analysis**: The research analyzed seismic data from 2007 to 2021, focusing on eight significant earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 or greater. The data showed that ground acceleration consistently exceeded 1 cm/s² during these events.\n\n3. **Frequency Analysis**: The study used various analytical methods to explore the frequency content of the seismic waves. It identified unique amplification effects at specific frequencies (0.1 to 0.3 Hz and smaller peaks at 0.5 and 2 Hz).\n\n4. **Site Characteristics**: The area is primarily composed of soft soils with low shear wave velocities, which contribute to the amplification of ground motions. The depth to bedrock varies across the region, impacting how seismic waves propagate.\n\n5. **Implications for Engineering**: The findings highlight the need for structural engineers to consider these amplification effects when designing buildings in Bangkok, especially given the potential for large earthquakes in nearby regions.\n\n6. **Further Research**: The paper suggests that additional studies using advanced ground motion modeling are necessary to fully understand the implications of these findings and improve earthquake preparedness in the Bangkok area.\n\nIn summary, this research provides crucial insights into how the geological features of the Bangkok Basin can amplify seismic activity, posing risks to high-rise structures and requiring careful consideration in building design and urban planning.",

This behavior was initially highlighted by @opa334, developer of TrollStore, on infosec.exchange two days ago and later in a Facebook post on Vietnamse J2TEAM forum. The controversy quickly gained traction because such behavior suggests a violation of Apple’s policies and an invasion of user privacy.The initial information in the Facebook post mentioned suspicions regarding our BShield Mobile Security solution, leading to a misunderstanding that inaccurately affected the reputation of BShield and Verichains. Therefore, we conducted a thorough technical analysis of the mentioned bank apps BIDV SmartBanking (v5.2.62, updated on Mar 14, 2025) and Agribank Plus (v5.1.8, updated on Mar 25, 2025), detailed in this write-up, which also examines implications for users and the banking apps.Disclaimer:\nThis analysis was released strictly for security research, transparency, and customer protection purposes. This document also aims to clarify false claims regarding BShield's involvement, promote technical transparency.\n\nWhile we strive for accuracy, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability with respect to the information, products, services, or related graphics contained in this blog for any purpose. The information provided in this article is not intended to encourage, guide, or support any actions that violate the policies of Apple, Google, or current legal regulations. We shall not be held liable for any damages or consequences arising from the misuse of the information presented in this analysis.Technical AnalysisTLDR;The apps (BIDV SmartBanking and Agribank Plus) were reported of using the private iOS API SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifierAndURLAndLaunchOptions to detect TrollStore and other applications installed on users’ devices. Technical analysis reveals that BIDV SmartBanking (v5.2.62, updated on Mar 14, 2025) and Agribank Plus (v5.1.8, updated on Mar 25, 2025), developed by VNPay, use commercial Mobile App Shield DexProtector/Licel and Dexguard/iXGuard, together with a self-developed code likely named “VNPay Runtime Protection” or “VNPShield”. VNPay Runtime Protection employs a mechanism exploiting side-channel issue of iOS private API SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifierAndURLAndLaunchOptions to detect app presence on user iOS devices, combining with a very weak XOR encryption trying to hide the private API strings from scanning. This side-channel issue works on latest iOS versions on non-jailbroken device. According to Apple Security Bounty Program,  this issue likely falls under the category \"Device attack via user-installed app – Unauthorized access to sensitive data\", qualifying for a $5,000 bug bounty. Exploiting private APIs to enumerate installed apps violates Apple App Store policies and pose a significant risk of App removal by Apple, potentially impacting millions of bank customers. This policy violation has NO relation to BShield of Verichains. The primary purpose of application shielding is to proactively protect banking applications against malicious apps on user devices, preventing account takeover, theft of money and personal data. From time to time, we are aware of various new detection methods, including certain tricks utilizing N-day exploits or private APIs. However, as an bank-grade Mobile App Protection solution protecting more than 100 millions users, BShield strictly uses only stable and legitimate detection techniques.  We do NOT use risky or dangerous methods, ensuring full compliance with store policies, prioritizing user and business security amid rising threats targeting banking apps.Mechanism of ObfuscationTo hide their use of the private API, the apps employ a very weak XOR encryption to obfuscate sensitive strings, such as API names and application bundle identifiers. This technique likely aims to conceal API strings from static analysis tools, making it harder to detect the misuse of APIs. At runtime, the encrypted strings are decrypted by XORing them with the key to reveal their original values.The key is “94826663\" on BIDV app (“41818020” on Agribank app) and encrypted data is stored in the data section. The decryption function, named RE_Decrypt_10233F108, can be represented in Python as:Snippet of  decrypted strings from encrypted dataFrom the decrypted strings, we noted that this code likely a part of a module named VNPay Runtime Protection. Returning to the original code, we observed string usage patterns as below:The code block works as below:Creating metadata for constants stored in the data section.Call swift_initStaticObject to initialize the static object and the value stored at another location in the data section (in this case, the result will be a Swift String object).Calling RE_Decrypt_10233F108 to decrypt strings to process.This could be simplified as v40 = dlopen(XOR_DECRYPT(X), 1), where X is the encrypted string in the data section. Sample code snippet invoking the an API call from decrypted stringsThe above code snippet equivalent to invoke the csops function from /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\"/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib\".csops(a1, a2, a3, a4);Similarly, the code using the same method to invoke other private APIs, for examples:Private API to detect Apps installed on users’ iOS devicesCode snippet detects TrollStore and other appsThe code check for installed application by calling private iOS API SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier with the bundle ID of the app. Typically, developers launch apps through schemes if supported. However, this API directly launches any app if the calling app has Apple-issued entitlement. Hence, this private API could be used as a side channel to verify app existence through returned error codes. Note that this API from SpringBoard is a private API and not officially provided by Apple for developers so using it violates Apple Store policy.List of some targeted apps checks:org.coolstar.SileoStorecom.opa334.Dopamine.roothidecom.roothide.managercom.cokepokes.AppStorePlusxyz.willy.Zebracom.opa334.Dopaminecom.kahsooa.piqwkk.dummyLLDB screenshot below at breakpoint in SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifierAndURLAndLaunchOptions showing the check for ”com.opa334.Dopamine.roothide”.SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifierAndURLAndLaunchOptions is called from SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier.The private API is used as a side channel to verify app existence through returned error codes:If installed: returns security policy error (error number 9) due to lack of Apple entitlement).If not installed: returns application not found (error number 7) .This demonstrates a side-channel exploit via private iOS verifying if an app is installed, executed in class call VNPShieldBridgingManager.However, when running the banking application that exploit this private API to detect software installed on a user's device, the app's console log will show error messages indicating attempts to launch applications without permissions.Apple Store Policy ViolationAccording to Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines (Sections 2.5.1 and Legal 5), using non-public (private) APIs or hidden system calls without explicit user consent breaches data transparency, user control, and security standards, undermining user trust.Specifically, Guideline 2.5.1 mandates that apps \"may only use public APIs\" and must utilize these APIs strictly for their intended purposes. Any use of internal, undisclosed system frameworks or functions will result in app rejection or removal. Apple enforces these guidelines to maintain app stability, protect user privacy, and uphold platform security.Beyond just compliance, abusing private APIs can be a security and privacy issue. Apple’s rules exist partly to prevent apps from accessing data or capabilities users didn’t consent to. For example, using hidden system calls to probe a device’s state can violate user privacy and platform security. Scanning a user’s device for other installed apps without permission is explicitly disallowed and undermines user trust.Attempting to bypass iOS sandbox restrictions or gather unauthorized data (e.g., installed app lists) is a major violation, raising serious red flags for Apple and security-conscious users. Such practices risk app bans or removal from the App Store, potentially impacting millions of bank customers.In this analysis, we confirm that SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier private API could be used as a side channel to verify app existence through returned error codes, works on latest iOS versions on non-jailbroken devices. From Apple Security Bounty Program,  this shall fall into “Device attack via user-installed app - Unauthorized access to sensitive data” for the $5,000 bug bounty. ConclusionTechnical analysis reveals that BIDV SmartBanking (v5.2.62, updated on Mar 14, 2025) and Agribank Plus (v5.1.8, updated on Mar 25, 2025), developed by VNPay, use commercial Mobile App Shield DexProtector/Licel and Dexguard/iXGuard, together with a self-developed code likely named “VNPay Runtime Protection” or “VNPShield”. VNPay Runtime Protection employs a mechanism exploiting side-channel issue of iOS private API SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifierAndURLAndLaunchOptions to detect app presence on user iOS devices, combining with a very weak XOR encryption trying to hide the private API strings from scanning. This side-channel issue works on latest iOS versions on non-jailbroken device. According to Apple Security Bounty Program,  this issue likely falls under the category \"Device attack via user-installed app – Unauthorized access to sensitive data\", qualifying for a $5,000 bug bounty. Exploiting private APIs to enumerate installed apps violates Apple App Store policies and pose a significant risk of App removal by Apple, potentially impacting millions of bank customers. This policy violation has NO relation to BShield of Verichains. The primary purpose of application shielding is to proactively protect banking applications against malicious apps on user devices, preventing account takeover, theft of money and personal data. From time to time, we are aware of various new detection methods, including certain tricks utilizing N-day exploits or private APIs. However, as an bank-grade Mobile App Protection solution protecting more than 100 millions users, BShield strictly uses only stable and legitimate detection techniques.  We do NOT use risky or dangerous methods, ensuring full compliance with store policies, prioritizing user and business security amid rising threats targeting banking apps.Subscribe to VerichainsLaunched 3 years agoLeading web3 security firm in APAC.

This is because in some sense it was way ahead of its time by being a decentralized communication system. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram or other messenger services, where the service provider has a centralized server (or nowadays a network of servers) processing all the messages; with emails, everybody can host their own mailserver to send and receive messages to everybody else. If Meta or Telegram decides to shut down their server, all communication is lost and the service cannot be used anymore. But with email, you can just move to another server (as long as you own your own domain at least).\nOne of the major components that power our modern email systems is the IMAP4 protocol. It is used to connect your email client to your mailserver. It’s the language used by the client to ask the server for the newest unread emails and the server responds with its contents. POP3 is (or was) also very popular and still widely supported but not used so much because it comes with a few drawbacks (a topic for another day). You probably have heard about SMTP as well, and this is the protocol that is used to send emails.\nBut those protocols alone don’t allow us to send emails. Emails heavily rely on other technologies like Domains, DNS, IPv4, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, SSL/TLS, S/MIME, PGP, NTP. In general, Emails are not too different from websites as they share a lot of the same technology (and nowadays you can even send HTML emails).\nHowever, in this blog post, I want to focus on IMAP, which stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. IMAP4 was released in 1994 as RFC 1730. The most recent version is IMAP4rev2 (released in 2021), as defined in RFC 9051 but most mail servers (as far as I can tell) still use IMAP4rev1 as defined in RFC 3501. It can be used to retrieve, manage, and manipulate email messages stored on a remote mail server, allowing users to perform actions such as searching, flagging, deleting, and organizing messages into folders while maintaining synchronization across multiple clients. Similarly, HTTP is a text-based protocol that relies on human-readable text commands and responses for communication between clients and servers.\nSo now, enough introduction - let’s get right into business. How do we connect to a mailserver?\nLike with HTML, we can use the telnet utility to build up a simple TCP connection to a mailserver:\n\nAfter connecting we are greeted with OK followed by a list of ‘capabilities‘, which is a list of features supported by the mailserver in the current state. It also shows us which IMAP version is supported. Sometimes (but not in the screenshot above) the server will also tell you what kind of software it is running. Most of the time you will see “Docevot“ being mentioned. Dovecot is a secure open-source IMAP & POP3 server running on Linux.\nIf we are fast enough and are not getting kicked out of the session because we idled too long, we can try to log in to authenticate ourselves.\nIn order to do that, we have to understand how the IMAP commands are structured.\nCopy<tag> <command> [arguments]\n\nThe tag prefix is supposed to be a unique tag within the session used to match the request and response. It can be anything but has to start with a letter and cannot contain spaces. While it’s supposed to be unique and typically look like A001, I’m lazy so I’ll always use just a. The server will then respond with:\nCopy<tag> <status> <response>\n\nThere are multiple ways to authenticate. The LOGIN command is the most straightforward one but is also considered insecure because it transmits the credentials in plaintext (especially when using unencrypted connections). I will use it anyway 🙃. There is also the AUTHENTICATE command, which uses SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). The most basic way to authenticate using SASL involves encoding the credentials in base64 but can go as far as sending hashes or using token-based authentication.\nNow if I try to log in, the following happens:\nCopya login michael@myemail.com MySecretPassword\na BAD [CLIENTBUG] Login is disabled\n\nOn most other servers, this will actually just work. But on this specific server, unencrypted connections like this are disabled.\nSo instead, let’s use OpenSSL to build up a secure connection and log in. Notice that we now have to use the 993 port instead of 143:\nCopy❯ openssl s_client -connect imap.myemail.com:993 -crlf -quiet\nConnecting to 123.123.123.123\ndepth=2 C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=DigiCert Global Root G2\nverify return:1\ndepth=1 C=US, O=DigiCert Inc, OU=www.digicert.com, CN=RapidSSL TLS RSA CA G1\nverify return:1\ndepth=0 CN=imap.myemail.com\nverify return:1\n* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE LITERAL+ AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=CRAM-MD5] Dovecot ready.\na login michael@myemail.com MySecretPassword\na OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE SORT SORT=DISPLAY THREAD=REFERENCES THREAD=REFS THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND URL-PARTIAL CATENATE UNSELECT CHILDREN NAMESPACE UIDPLUS LIST-EXTENDED I18NLEVEL=1 CONDSTORE QRESYNC ESEARCH ESORT SEARCHRES WITHIN CONTEXT=SEARCH LIST-STATUS BINARY MOVE SNIPPET=FUZZY PREVIEW=FUZZY PREVIEW STATUS=SIZE SAVEDATE LITERAL+ NOTIFY SPECIAL-USE QUOTA] Logged in\n\nFinally, we get an ‘OK‘ and a new list of the now unlocked capabilities (not every server sends us the new capabilities automatically; sometimes you have to issue the CAPABILITY command manually). This should also increase the time we have until we get thrown out of the session for inactivity.\nWe can now list all our folders:\nCopya LIST \"\" \"*\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked) \"/\" CustomFolder\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked \\Archive) \"/\" Archives\n* LIST (\\HasChildren \\Marked \\Trash) \"/\" Trash\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked) \"/\" Trash/OldStuff\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked \\Drafts) \"/\" Drafts\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked \\Sent) \"/\" Sent\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren \\UnMarked \\Junk) \"/\" Spam\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \"/\" INBOX\na OK List completed (0.018 + 0.000 + 0.017 secs).\n\nEven though the main inbox folder is named INBOX by convention, this helps us to identify the structure of our mailbox and where to look for new mail! We can also see folders marked with flags like \\Sent which IMAP uses for special functionality. Next, we need to select one of those folders:\nCopya SELECT INBOX\n* FLAGS (\\Answered \\Flagged \\Deleted \\Seen \\Draft NonJunk $Forwarded Junk)\n* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\\Answered \\Flagged \\Deleted \\Seen \\Draft NonJunk $Forwarded Junk \\*)] Flags permitted.\n* 4183 EXISTS\n* 0 RECENT\n* OK [UIDVALIDITY <secret>] UIDs valid\n* OK [UIDNEXT <secret>] Predicted next UID\n* OK [HIGHESTMODSEQ <secret>] Highest\na OK [READ-WRITE] Select completed (0.007 + 0.000 + 0.006 secs).\n\nAnd this tells us that I have 4183 emails in the inbox!\nNow that we have selected a folder, we can search in it! If our capabilities contain SEARCH=FUZZY we can add the FUZZY keyword to enable a fuzzy search (otherwise just leave it out):\nCopya SEARCH FUZZY SUBJECT \"buy\"\n* SEARCH 1082 1236 1830 3141 3263 4149 7401 10113 10118 10240 18106 18107 18113 18139 18140 18142 18270 18966 19226 20675 20684 20695 20709 26406\na OK SEARCH completed (12.310 s)\n\nAmongst others, you can use BODY to search in the body, SUBJECT to search in the subject or TEXT to search in both. I can then use the FETCH command to display one of those IDs (or any others):\nCopya FETCH 26046 (BODY[])\n* 26046 FETCH (BODY[] {130059}\nX-Envelope-From: <****@email.epicgames.com>\nX-Envelope-To: <michael@myemail.com>\nX-Delivery-Time: 1725393397\nX-UID: <secret>\nReturn-Path: ....\n\nIt starts with the headers and will eventually show the contents further down. This format is called MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) as defined in RFC 2045-2049.\nNow we can search and read emails via the command line without the help of any email client. Of course, we can do a lot more with IMAP but this will get you started. Remember for sending emails we need to use SMTP instead - I might cover this in future as well!\n.post-floating-bar {\n              bottom: -60px;\n            }\n            .post-floating-bar.animation {\n              -webkit-transition: .2s all;\n              -o-transition: .2s all;\n              transition: .2s all;\n              transition-timing-function: ease-in;\n            }\n            .post-floating-bar.active {\n              bottom: 40px\n            }\n            .post-floating-bar.freeze {\n              bottom: 0!important;\n              position: absolute!important;\n              transition: none!important;\n            }\n            .post-floating-bar.freeze > div {\n              box-shadow: none!important;\n            }\n\n          @keyframes slideUpAndFade {\n            from {\n              opacity: 0;\n              transform: translateY(2px);\n            }\n            to {\n              opacity: 1;\n              transform: translateY(0);\n            }\n          }\n\n          .reaction-count-tooltip-content {\n            box-shadow: hsl(206 22% 7% / 35%) 0px 10px 38px -10px, hsl(206 22% 7% / 20%) 0px 10px 20px -15px;\n            user-select: none;\n            transition: .2s all;\n            animation-duration: 400ms;\n            animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n            will-change: transform, opacity;\n          }\n          .reaction-count-tooltip-content[data-state='instant-open'][data-side='top'] {\n            animation-name: slideUpAndFade;\n          }\n\n          @keyframes shake {\n            0% { transform: translateX(0) }\n            25% { transform: translateX(1px) }\n            50% { transform: translateX(-1px) }\n            75% { transform: translateX(1px) }\n            100% { transform: translateX(0) }\n          }\n          .shake {\n            animation-name: shake;\n            animation-iteration-count: 2;\n            animation-duration: 400ms;\n            animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);\n            will-change: transform, opacity;\n          }\n          Subscribe to our newsletterRead articles from Michi's Blog directly inside your inbox.

I just like old computers :(\nWindows 9x QuickInstall\n\nDescription\nThis is a framework that is intended for creating and preparing Windows 98 installation ISO images in a way that is optimized for extremely quick installation, similar to nLite, but with a completely different method and context.\nIt takes the root file system of an already installed Windows 98 system and packages it, whilst allowing drivers and tools to be slipstreamed at will.\nFor the installer, it uses Linux as a base, paired with some tools to allow hard disk partitioning and formatting, as well as  a custom installer with a custom data packing method that is optimized for streaming directly from CD to the hard disk without any seeking.\nBottom line, this means that the effort for the user to build an ISO is higher than for example nLite, but the degree of customizability is also massively increased.\nHow fast is it really?\nOn a Pentium III class machine with ATA / ATAPI Ultra DMA available for all storage devices, Windows 98 -- using an ISO built with this framework -- can be installed from CD in roughly 60-90 seconds.\nBuilding the Framework, Bugs, License, etc.\nSee BUILDING.md.\nI don't want to read and/or do all of this.\nOkay. Go to the releases tab :-)\nSupported Target Operating Systems\n\nMicrosoft Windows 98 (Build 4.10.1998)\nMicrosoft Windows 98 Second Edition (Build 4.10.2222)\nMicrosoft Windows Millenium Edition (Build 4.90.3000)\n\nSupport for international versions is not properly tested. It should work and in my testing it does, but YMMV. Please report bugs!\nNO versions of Windows 95 are supported due to non-PNP device detection being part of the DOS-based installer stage.\nSystem requirements to use QuickInstall\n\ni486-class CPU, at least a 486SX (but it will be very slow)\n24 MiB of memory\nAn IDE / SATA / SCSI controller supported by Linux\n\nHow to boot a QuickInstall image\nThere are several provided methods to boot into Windows 98 QuickInstall:\n\nCD/DVD-ROM boot\nThe Windows 98 QuickInstall ISO image can be booted on any computer that supports floppy-emulation CD-ROM boot.\nRecommended if you have a PC that supports CD-ROM boot.\n\n1.44M floppy boot with DOS (dosflop.img)\nThis is a 1.44M floppy disk image that contains FreeDOS and LOADLIN to boot the kernel directly off the CD-ROM.\nRecommended if you have a computer that does not support CD-ROM boot or wish to install from a hard disk.\nAlso recommended if you have the QuickInstall files on an ATA/ATAPI media or other device that is exposed using Int 13h\nIf you have a SCSI CD-ROM, the image must be modified accordingly.\n\n1.44M floppy boot with tiny kernel (floppy.img)\nThis is a 1.44M floppy disk image that contains a proper kernel.\nRecommended only if you have QuickInstall on a non-ATA/ATAPI media and your BIOS does not support CD-ROM boot.\nThe kernel on this image is limited in functionality, driver support and does not enable kernel logs (no printk, no dmesg)\nDue to the strong compression, it takes a very long time to boot on slow systems. It is only meant as a last resort.\n\nRemovable media such as USB Flash Drives\nUsing the system preparation script it is possible to create bootable USB images. The steps to do so are described below.\n\nSystem requirements to build QuickInstall Images\n\nWindows 7, 8.1, 10 or 11\nOR\nModern Linux variant or WSL\nTested with:\n\nWindows 10 21H2, Build 19044.2846\nWindows Subsystem For Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS)\nUbuntu 20.04.4 LTS (native)\n\npython (3.5 or newer)\n\nOn Windows 7 and 8.1:\nDownload a python installation package from https://www.python.org/downloads/\n\nOn Windows 10 and 11:\nUse the Microsoft Store to download an appropriate variant.\n\nOn Linux (Debian, Ubuntu):\nsudo apt install python3.8\n\nScript requirements\nRun the following command in the framework directory:\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\nmkisofs from cdrtools\n\nOn Windows:\nTool is bundled with the framework, no action required.\n\nOn Linux (Debian, Ubuntu):\nsudo apt install genisofs\n\nwine (Linux Only)\nsudo apt install wine\nMany parts of the ISO building process are Windows specific and not able to be cleanly implemented natively on Linux, such as modifying system registry, parsing driver INF files, etc.\n\n86Box (recommended) or another virtual machine capable of installing Windows 9x\n\nSoftware to extract files from a hard disk image\ne.g. 7zip (on Linux: sudo apt install p7zip-full)\n\nThe system preparation script (sysprep.py)\nThis script serves the purpose of preparing an installation for packaging into an ISO and/or USB image file.\nIt takes the following parameters:\n\n--iso <ISO>\nInstructs the script to create an ISO image with the given file name\n\n--usb <USB>\nInstructs the script to create an USB key image with the given file name\n\n--osroot <OSROOT>\nSpecifies a Windows 98 / ME system root directory (\"OS Root\") to be used.\nThis can be specified multiple times, in which case the installation wizard will show a selection menu.\n\n--extra <EXTRA>\nInstructs the script to add the files in this directory to the final ISO/USB output.\nDefault: _EXTRA_CD_FILES_ in the framework directory\nThis can be specified multiple times, all the files in all the directories will be added in this case\n\n--drivers <DRIVERS>\nInstructs the script to process slipstream all drivers in this directory.\nSlipstream means that these drivers will be installed automatically when the hardware for them is detected at any point of the installation's lifetime, even when the hardware is not yet present at the time of installation.\nDefault: _DRIVER_ in the framework directory. It already contains a curated selection of drivers.\nThis parameter can only be specified once.\n\n--extradrivers <EXTRADRIVERS>\nInstructs the script to process all drivers in this directory and add them into the extra drivers directory.\nThese drivers are NOT slipstreamed and thus not automatically installed. They are however made available on the resulting installation media and can be installed by pointing the Windows 98 / ME Add New Hardware wizard to the DRIVER.EX directory on the media.\nThe reason for this folder's existence is the vast selection of hardware available for the operating systems and the varying compatibility / size of them.\nVery large drivers are recommended to go in here, as well as drivers for which it cannot be assumed that different versions have different compatibility and speed.\nFor example, it is better to choose an older driver for an older nVidia GeForce card even though a newer one would also support this hardware for speed reasons, whilst the newer driver should also be available, in case newer hardware is present.\nDefault: _EXTRA_DRIVER_ in the framework directory. It already contains a curated selection of drivers.\nThis parameter can only be specified once.\n\n--verbose VERBOSE\n\nThis parameter controls console output verbosity of the script.\nWhere VERBOSE is either True or False.\nThe default is False.\nThis parameter is currently broken, sorry. It's always quiet.\nPreparing a Windows 98 / ME installation for packaging\n\nInstall Windows 98 / ME in a virtual machine or emulator, just as you want it.\nI recommend using 86Box using the following configuration:\n\nMachine:\n\nMachine Type: Slot 1\nAchine: [i440BX] ABIT BF6\nCPU type: Intel Pentium II (Deschutes)\nMemory: 64 MB\n\nDisplay:\n\nVideo: [ISA] VGA (or any video card that does not have an integrated driver in Windows 98 / ME)\n\nNetwork:\n\nNone, VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE NETWORK DRIVER SETUP STAYS INTACT!!\n\nHard disks:\n\nIDE (0:0), raw image, big enough to install the operating system.\n\nIt is recommended that you install Windows in APM mode, because ACPI is a buggy mess (setup /p i).\nWARNING: The operating system must be installed from the HARD DISK and it must contain a folder containing the Windows 98 CAB files from the CDROM. Otherwise, drivers can not be slipstreamed.\nNOTE: It is recommended that NO extra drivers are installed in this VM.\n\nConfigure the Windows 98 / ME installation as you wish. Examples:\n\nMachine name\nUser name\nSystem options\nThemes\nPatches\nUtilities\nSoftware\n\nShut down the virtual machine and DO NOT TURN IT BACK ON\n\nUse 7zip or an imaging software and extract the entire root of the\npartition you installed Windows 98 to.\nExtract all files into a directory. We will call this the OS Root. The default for this is _OS_ROOT_ in the framework directory.\nOn Windows, you can open the image file using the 7zip File Manager or the 7zip context menu. Or WinImage, et cetera.\nOn Linux, you can do this with by using '7z' from the p7zip-full package.\n7z x -o_OS_ROOT_/ /path/to/image/file\nWARNING: Only one Windows directory is allowed, and only one Windows setup files CAB directory. If you install using 98Lite, make sure that the 98Lite setup directory is the sole carrier of these CABs.\nINFO: The script detects the Windows directory by finding WIN.COM\nINFO: The CAB file directory is detected by finding PRECOPY2.CAB\nThis location must be specified when running the script by using the --osroot parameter.\n\nPreparing & Packaging\n\nCopy drivers that you want slipstreamed into a directory of your choice. By default this is _DRIVER_ in the framework directory directory.\nNOTE: _DRIVER_ is already filled with a curated selection of drivers. Ycan remove these, if you wish.\nIf you choose a non-default directory for this, you must specify it using the --drivers parameter.\n\nCopy extra drivers that will not be slipstreamed but added to a directory of your choice. By default this is _EXTRA_DRIVER_ in the framework directory.\nNOTE: These drivers will be processed in the same way as the slipstreamed ones but will not be copied to the hard drive during installation.\nINFO: This folder will be named DRIVER.EX on the ISO. You can point the Windows 98 hardware wizard to this folder and the drivers will be found and installed correctly.\nNOTE: _EXTRA_DRIVER_ is already filled with a curated selection of drivers. Ycan remove these, if you wish.\nIf you choose a non-default directory for this, you must specify it using the --extradrivers parameter.\n\nAdd any extra files you wish added to the ISO to a directory of your choice. By default this is _EXTRA_CD_FILES in the framework directory.\nThis can include drivers that you do not wish to be processed with the QuickInstall tools, e.g. drivers that contain bundled software.\nIf you choose a non-default directory for this, you must specify it using the --extra parameter.\n\nRun the following command to build the package:\nsysprep.py --osroot <OS Root Folder>\nNOTE: You must add the other parameters if you deviate from the defaults.\nThis will build the installation package in the _OUTPUT_ directory in the Framework directory.\nIf you want to create an ISO image or a bootable USB key image, see below.\nWARNING: THE OS DIRECTORIES WILL BE MODIFIED IN PLACE!\n\nCreating a bootable ISO image\n\nUse the --iso parameter for the sysprep.py script.\ne.g. adding --iso output.iso to the command line will yield a file named output.iso that can be burned to a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray or used in a virtual machine.\nRefer to the parameter descriptions above for more information.\n\nCreating a bootable USB key image\n\nUse the --usb parameter for the sysprep.py script.\ne.g. adding --usb output.img to the command line will yield a file named output.img that can be written to a USB key, SD or CF card, hard disk or other media.\nRefer to the parameter descriptions above for more information.\n\nHow to write the bootable USB image to a USB flash drive\n\nOn Linux, you can use dd\n\ndd if=<USB image file> of=/dev/sdX bs=1024k status=progress\nReplace /dev/sdX with the USB flash drive's device path.\n\nOn Windows, you can use the following tools:\n\ndd For Windows: http://www.chrysocome.net/dd\nWin32 DiskImager: https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/\n\nPackaging multiple operating systems in one image\nThis is an advanced feature.\nBy specifying the --osroot parameter multiple times, you can create a multi-variant installation image. In this case a selection menu will appear during installation prompting the user which variant should be installed.\nExample:\npython3 sysprep.py --osroot D:\\quickinstall\\Windows98SE --osroot D:\\quickinstall\\WindowsME --iso multi.iso\nwin98qi.inf\nThis file should be present in every OS Root directory. It contains the display name of the installation in the variant selection menu shown in the installer.\nIt should fit on the screen.\nIt can be ASCII or UTF8 encoded.\nFAQ\nQ: Windows 98 / ME complains about system file integrity when I create an image after a Daylight Savings Time swap-over\nA: This is a weird glitch that happens on Windows hosts where files created after DST are suddenly are offset by one hour.\nIn the future, the sysprep script will work with Hard Disk image files, which will make this a non-issue.\nWorkaround 1: Re-extract the files from the hard disk image you used as the base to create your image\nWorkaround 2: Create images on Linux\nWorkaround 3: Wait until summer :-)\nQ: Windows 98 / ME complains about missing CAT files when installing a driver from the extra drivers\nA: 98Lite deletes the catalog root directory to save installation space. Catalog files can safely be skipped, but if the error annoys you, you can unpack them from the Win98 CAB files to prevent it.\nQ: I'm getting a python error about non-zero return code in msdos.exe right after Using SHELL32.xxx to reboot!\nExample:\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['L:\\\\win98-installer\\\\__BIN__\\\\tools\\\\msdos.exe', 'L:\\\\win98-installer\\\\__BIN__\\\\registry\\\\regedit.exe', '/L:SYSTEM.DAT', '/R:USER.DAT', 'tmp.reg']' returned non-zero exit status 1.\n\nA: This problem happens when running the script on Windows whilst the script directory is in a share hosted by a WSL session (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This causes some incompatibilities. Run the script from the WSL Linux shell instead.\nQ: All the operating system files are un-hidden after installation! Why?\nA: You've probably used Linux to do the image creation. Linux has no concept of hidden files, therefore this file property cannot be replicated in the images.\nQ: I'm getting I/O and read errors, segmentation faults and other weird behavior when installing from CD on an Intel i430 / i440-based system with an Intel 82371SB south bridge (e.g. i440FX)\nA: This problem has been verified by Deksor, Rigo and myself, and is a deeply rooted problem that has existed since at least version 2.4.xx. Operating the drives in PIO mode can help.\nA BIOS update may help, the issue is currently under investigation as we found some BIOS versions where this problem does not occur.\nFor now, you can work around this problem by using a PCI SCSI or IDE adapter card that supports CD-ROM boot or has DOS drivers with the DOS boot floppy option.\nQ: I'm trying to install on a VIA MVP3-based motherboard and I'm getting a \"General Protection Fault\" on the first boot. (Repoted by Rigo)\nA: To work around this issue, select the \"slow\" hardware detection variant in the installation wizard. The problem is currently under investigation.\nQ: I'm trying to install on my 486 and I'm getting Disk I/O errors!\nA: Your BIOS might have an incomplete/buggy LBA implementation. Partition the drive to use a FAT32 non-LBA partition and try again.\nQ: I'm getting a While initializing device VCACHE: Windows protection error when running on my modern PC (Ryzen, Intel 13th gen, etc.)\nInstall the CREGFIX patch (the reference ISOs contain it in the extras folder):\nhttps://github.com/mintsuki/cregfix\nFor technical reasons this patch cannot be pre-installed with the ISO and must be applied manually.",

How we could be sure this was an attack? After all, we had no baseline for this user …Let’s dive in. The User Timeline: 1 Failed Login —> 1 Successful LoginThis is all the data we had for the user at the time of the attack:1-26-25: Failed login to Microsoft Azure CLI from Hurricane Electric LLC, a data center in Mexico1-29-25: Successful login to Microsoft Azure CLI from different IP in the same data centerFrom just these two logins, it’s pretty tricky to tell whether this is expected behavior or an attack. On one hand, command line logins usually come from people running cloud computing workloads in data centers. Programmatic workloads also often rotate IPs using tools like FireProx. On the other hand, this could be an attacker who compromised this account with a brute force script. Perhaps they’re using the data center to run a large scale attack campaign targeting users all over the world. The key to solving this case is to look beyond this single user and examine all the recent activity in this tenant. The Tenant Timeline: 24 Users Targeted in 1 WeekWhen we look at all the logins for this tenant from Mexico, we see an attack campaign hiding in plain sight: this attacker targeted 24 distinct users using Microsoft Azure CLI. They tried every user no more than 2 times to avoid setting off any brute force detections. They also used a slew of IPs from the range 2001:0470:c8e0::/48 to evade any IOC-based detections. Takeaway: Looking at User Activity Timelines Isn’t EnoughThe repeated failed logins across multiple users, combined with clear attempts to avoid triggering alarms, make it clear that this is an attack. We would have missed this if we just analyzed the activity timelines for each individual user.Slicing Microsoft’s logs in creative ways allows us to unmask attackers hiding in plain sight. In this particular case, shifting our perspective from user activity to tenant-wide activity was the key.

It describes a specific case where an attacker attempted to log in to multiple accounts using a technique that involved trying to access 24 different user accounts within a week, while limiting login attempts to avoid detection. \n\nKey points include:\n\n- The initial observation involved one user with a failed login followed by a successful one, making it hard to determine if it was an attack.\n- Upon examining all logins for the tenant, the team found a pattern of failed and successful logins that indicated malicious activity.\n- The attacker used multiple IP addresses and limited their attempts to evade detection.\n- The main takeaway is that focusing solely on individual user activity can miss broader attack patterns; analyzing tenant-wide activity is crucial for identifying such threats.\n\nIn summary, a wider perspective on login activities helps uncover attackers that might otherwise go unnoticed.",

Amazon Nova includes three models (Nova Micro, Lite, and Pro) that generate text from different modalities and are incredibly fast, capable and cost-effective, and two additional models for generating high-quality images (Nova Canvas) and videos (Nova Reel) from text and image input.Image generation via Amazon Nova Canvas on nova.amazon.com.Beginning today, developers also have access to a research preview of the Amazon Nova Act SDK on nova.amazon.com. Powered by an early version of a customized Amazon Nova model, this SDK allows developers to build agents that can complete tasks in a web browser.We think of agents as systems that can complete tasks and act in a range of digital and physical environments on behalf of the user. Today, such agents are still in an early stage. The Nova Act SDK is a crucial step forward, toward building reliable agents by enabling developers to break down complex workflows into atomic commands (e.g., search, checkout, answer questions about the screen). It also enables developers to add more detailed instructions to those commands where needed (e.g., “don’t accept the insurance upsell”), call APIs, and more to further strengthen reliability.Nova Act searches apartments by biking distance to the train station.Whether you're a builder testing model behavior, a business professional exploring new AI capabilities, a creative looking for inspiration, or a developer interested in experimenting with an agent, nova.amazon.com is the easiest way to experience understanding, content generation, and agentic models from Amazon.Your guide to free and low-cost AWS courses that can help you use generative AIMore than 135 AWS trainings on AI/ML are available to everyone, with all levels of experience.U.S.-based customers with an Amazon account can simply visit nova.amazon.com to begin exploring today, or to download Nova Act to start building agents.

Use Wifi, bluetooth devices, web applications, various remote control tools and some markdown / txt editors and have access to a shell.As laptop user, the rest doesn't matter to me.So yeah Linux is definitively a great OS Desktop.And a big mess as Server OS : #Like every other sys/{ops,admin,store}, my company/customers use RHEL or Centos when it is necessary to use a LinuxAnd to be honest after dozens of year of administration; troubleshooting, workarround. I still didn’t understand HOW this factory works.And I've read tons of RedHat documentation / KB.warning SystemD.TLDR : the main problem is SYSTEMD, the secondary problem is the stacking of abstraction layers docker / kubersomething most of the time used of unknown reasons “just because it's modern”.Don’t keep it Simple let’s do something complicated : #Looks like this is the new mantra ! The new “MicroService” way of life that’s generated gigatons of logs impossible to debug when you have issue on production.Another point : everything that systemD manages (i.e. the entire system) makes things complicated.Simple things like device mounting, which you'd think would be handled entirely by /etc/fstab, can be bypassed by systemd options.Complicated stuff = high probably of failure = Complicated issue to troubleshoot in productionIf you 2024 backend/system Product/Owner/Developpeur ... what ever please mark theses words !warning Reminder :In other words : Overall system reliability is therefore the product of the individual reliability of each component.Thus, the more components there are in the system (excepted redundancy), the greater the probability that at least one component will fail, reducing overall system reliability.Example with a simple system the GNU/Linux log management : #As you can see log management is pretty simple on SystemD/Linux.When one of your service doesn’t trace anymore more the easiest way is to restart everything (journalct , syslog, rsyslog, syslog.socket ... who knows)Also it’s pretty common on overloaded systemd to see journalctl consumming 100% of one core.Could luck for trying to mitigate this.I can ask you the same question what is the righ tool to use for Debian when you want deal with packages ? apt , aptitude, apt-get ?We can also talk about the network configuration which can be done with nmcli or by changing config file ...It doesn't really matter in a desktop environment. But on a server configuration, it does matter when 3 years later you have to reinstall the machine.Yeah Debian ... 😁 #Don’t talk me about SystemD/Debian please ...Long time ago like a lot of people I was an sysadmin home user of Debian. I was running my services with “almost” RIP OpenVZ a paravirtualisation solution. At that time, Docker was just beginning to appear.It was perfectly supported in 2.8 Kernel (Debian 8 or something even older) but for some reasons the Debian project choosen to not include the OpenVZ into the next Debian release as upstream solution. The only way to continue using OpenVZ was to ... downgrade its kernel to continue taking advantage of portability ?!!And if you want to keep using OpenVZ you have to use DevianWhat a joke.So I have to redo all my “architecture” redeploy all my service into a new container solution ?! Rewrite/test the backup Script and so on ... Ho thank you and good bye Debian !Professional distributions with which you can't even do a rolling upgrade (Rhel / Rocky) : #That’s probably the biggest joke for a profesionnal distribution : if you want to jump from 1 main branch to another one you have to reinstall everything (or use tools like leap)Yeah I know , you can do it with Debian/Fedora/Arch (which is rolling).And with FreeBSD 😎 #Everything is simple , everything is documented, everything make sense.Ok things are probably a bit “old-school” and use the old Unix-way to do thing.But this is what we like/needs in production : simplicity and stability !I ran FreeBSD on my personnals server since 9.x released and so far upgrade after upgrade no breaking changes !Everything works since the beginning.Of course, I've changed physical servers several times and had to deal with disaster recovery situations. Each time, the operation of restarting the services proved to be simple and effective.Restoring from disaster (macro plan) : #Basically you have to :Restore you /home or /rootRestore /etc/rc.confRestore your firewall configuration /etc/pf.confRestore your service that are all running into a jailEt voila.Pros : #This is problably the main point : All is simple with FreeBSD.All the programme will have there configuration files into /usr/local/etcMemory / CPU footprint is minimalBy default logs are managed by newsyslog not a labyrinthine system.Jails are so powerfull to manage tons of services and still there since FreeBSD 6.x ... This is a nativ tool of FreeBSD. There are severals wrapper iocage/bastille/ezjail ... but basically this is still the same thing : jail and you can easily migrate from one wrapper to another. Build easy network setting or complicated secured stuff. Mount a NFS share within the jail ... You don’t have to choose between, lxd,lxc, docker,containerd ...Virtualisation is nice and powerfull with Bhyve : Post to follow on this topic.Whole system configuration is done in /etc/rc.confThe firewall solution availables are awesome (Packet Filter).pkg to manage packets, that’s all.You don’t have to cross your finger when you run an OS major upgrade.The network stack is fast and efficient.ZFS is more efficient on FreeBSD (Insert Source)Cons : #Probably a few sleepless nights to get things like bluethooth working ...You'll have to be more adventurous to run a full desktop environment (even if it works!).Still a bit Unix old-fashion way to manage things ? But is it a problem finally ?The biggest issue with FreeBSD : The very bad habbit of developper to deploy OpenSource software only with Docker 😈 #There is a new fashion on the OpenSource world. Developpers think Docker is the new de-facto standard and only propose to install the tools with Docker.Most of the time they do no provide any DOCUMENTATION to install their software in a baremetal way.At best, they offer an .rpm or .deb package for installation on a non-docker OS.But most of the time it's a docker file.Even worse, modern applications often deploy the code and database needed to run the code directly in the docker compose file.At what point did these people think it was relevant to run 10 different databases when I'm hosting 10 applications ?By chance the FreeBSD communauty is determined and competent and will alway try a way to create a packet for freeBSD 😇Identified Software that sucks hard with there docker deploy mode : #note NoteMaybe change this chapter into dedicated page if the list grows.Immich : At least there is a doc to deploy on TrueNas but this is just Screeshot and nothing about how to deploy by hand (Also this app also deploy PostgreSQL ... Dude I have allready a mutualised MariaDB I just want to deploy your app into my database, not bootstrap tons of other components) :Complexity level to deploy on FreeBSD : Medium / hard (Probably doable by spending some week end on this).BunkerWeb : This is supposed to be a Nginx hardened on steroïds, On the Github there is any documentation to deploy / build the app from SOURCE, use docker / kub / rpm / .deb or NOTHING.Complexity level to deploy on FreeBSD : Hard , I’ve tried to read the files on the .deb and this is tons of python scripts that installs dozen of lua/rpm module .. Why this is so complicated to deploy a Nginx with some Lua scripts ?Silverbullet : Ho my god I love this app 😍 I use it on daily-basis as my note garden. I will probably create a page about this app later. I recently create a init scrip to start it and it works fine.Complexity level to deploy on FreeBSD : EasyList to be continued ...{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"Why do I run FreeBSD for my home servers.\",\"image\":[\"https://aumont.fr/img/remote/ZdW06x-1920w.png\"],\"author\":\"Mathieu Aumont\",\"genre\":\"Insert a schema.org genre\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Maumont corporation\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"/img/favicon/favicon-192x192.png?hash=2089033c93\"}},\"url\":\"https://aumont.fr/posts/FreeBSD-Home-Server/\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https://aumont.fr/posts/FreeBSD-Home-Server/\",\"datePublished\":\"2024-11-19\",\"dateModified\":\"\",\"description\":\"Linux is pretty nice as Desktop : # In 2024 GNU/Linux is now a pretty nice OS as Desktop environnement you can absolutely runs everything...\"}",

Byrd.\n\n Destination Guide\n\n                  Antarctica\n\n                63 Articles\n\n                37 Places\n\n            Everyone in Antarctica knows Ivan. Even those that haven’t had the pleasure of riding inside of him—in comfortable seats, surrounded by wood paneling and the pleasant sounds of jazz warbling from his internal speakers as he rumbles slowly along the ice—have heard of him and probably walked right past him, sitting pretty near McMurdo Station’s cafeteria in his iconic orange-and-white livery.\nRecently, rumors grew that Ivan’s time on the ice was coming to an end, and it was time for the old bus to be retired. This caused an outcry among his longtime fans, who feared that he would end up unceremoniously scrapped for parts—a potentially sad end for such an iconic vehicle.\nIvan the Terra Bus arrived in McMurdo Sound in 1994, a shiny new supplement to the existing Delta passenger transport vehicles that had been brought over in the 1970s by the U.S. Navy. This fleet was responsible for bringing people from the runways out on the ice, where passenger planes would land after taking off from New Zealand, to the two national bases on Ross Island—America’s McMurdo and New Zealand’s smaller Scott Base. The hefty vehicle was about 46 feet long and 12 and a half feet wide, with a turning radius of 160 feet—the equivalent of the width of a football field. It had enormous tires with nearly six-foot diameters, and a ladder was required to climb up into its interior, which could accommodate up to 56 passengers. “It was warm and big and impressive,” remembers scientist David Theil, who rode in Ivan in 1995 when he was still almost brand new.\nA young Ivan the Terra Bus in 1994, shortly after his arrival in Antarctica. Courtsey of Chris ‘Xenon’ Hanson\n\n        ATLAS OBSCURA BOOKS\n\n        A Visual Odyssey Through the Marvels of Life\n        Venture into Nature's Unseen Realms with Our New Book Atlas Obscura: Wild Life\n\n        Order Now\n\nAntarctic veterans remember the contest that was held among McMurdo residents to name the bus when it arrived. Roy Harrison, a mechanic, remembers being disappointed that his own suggestion, “Magic Bus” (in honor of the song by The Who) wasn’t chosen. The winning name “Ivan the Terra Bus,” was, of course, a reference to Ivan the Terrible, legendary medieval tsar of Russia; there’s also the happy coincidence that “Terra Bus,” the name that the Canadian manufacturer Foremost gave the model in 1981, sounds very much like a pun on the two Ross Island mountains that rise above McMurdo Station—Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. Those mountains were named after the two ships that first explored the regions, HMS Terror and Erebus (more famous, perhaps, for later being lost in the Arctic with John Franklin’s doomed expedition).\n“Ivan the Terra Bus” was suggested by the engineer John Wright, whose main accomplishment was masterminding the thousand-mile snow road between McMurdo Station, on the edge of the continent, and Amundsen-Scott South Pole station at its center. That wasn’t a route Ivan ever took, though. His job was solely to rumble along between the airfields and the stations, and pretty soon after arriving he became a staple of life at McMurdo, the subject of songs, jokes, and fond memories. Bill Jirsa and Allison “Sandwich” Barden wrote this ditty during the 2006-7 summer season to celebrate Ivan:\nHe’s Ivan the Terra Bus / He’s bringing our friends to us / He took some friends away / Took them down to the Ice Runway / Someday he’ll come for us …/ He’s Ivan the Terra Bus!\nThere were certain quirks about Ivan that his drivers and passengers grew to love. He was rather slow compared to the smaller Deltas, taking over an hour to reach McMurdo from the airfields, but the ride was always memorable. The day the vehicle was unloaded from the cargo ship at the ice pier, an overenthusiastic driver backed Ivan into a bollard, resulting in a large dent on his rear bumper. This dent, which went unfixed, was forever known as “Charlie’s Folly” after the driver, and was marked thusly with permanent marker. Stickers were plastered all over Ivan’s charming wood-paneled interior, mementoes of Antarctic projects, excursions, and memes—such as a picture of a penguin holding a knife with the slogan “BECOME UNGOVERNABLE.”\nStickers plastered on the wood-paneled interior of Ivan the Terra Bus. Courtesy of Eric Chevreuil\nBex Henderson first arrived on the ice in 2018, long after Ivan had become part of everyday life at the station, but she was still honored to get to drive him every day. It wasn’t an easy job. “He had a whole set of instructions just to even get him turned on,” she remembers, involving a 30-to-60 minute engine warm-up period, and easily fogged windows that often meant having to drive with poor visibility for the beginning of a ride. But, she says, “Ivan could just make it through anything. I mean, he just floated across when the roads went bad,” as opposed to the Deltas and the 65-passenger Kress trailer, which often got bogged down in slushy snow and transitional terrain, and led to passengers being stranded out on the ice.\nSome of the newer vans that arrived after Ivan were preferred for their speed and comfort, when it came to getting to and from the base quickly, but Ivan was always the slow but steady old reliable of the airfield fleet. “Have you really been to Antarctica if you didn’t get picked up in Ivan?” Henderson says.\nIvan’s impending retirement was a cause for alarm among his passengers and fans. As replacement parts stopped being manufactured, repairs became difficult and fixes required increasingly expensive manufacturing and engineering. That’s a lot of money and effort for a 30-year-old bus, no matter how beloved, especially at a time when the National Science Foundation’s Antarctic efforts are facing increasing budget cuts and threats from political upheaval.\nOnce Ivan was given a name, it was painted onto the side of the bus, just above one of the massive wheel wells. Eli Duke / CC BY-SA 2.0\nEric Chevreuil, a longtime USAP worker in various departments including supply and IT, was distressed to find out during the 2024–25 summer season that Ivan’s fate had been sealed. The beloved Terra Bus had apparently been slated for auction at Port Hueneme, California, due to be inevitably scrapped for metal value or, Chevreuil imagined, bought cheaply to decorate someone’s roadside farm equipment store and then left to rust. Chevreuil was determined to prevent that from happening.\n“Ivan was a safe haven, a whole experience by itself, especially on our first deployment, [our] first trip from the icefield to the station,” he remembers. “Warm, wooden panels, some jazz music in the background, muffled sounds of various conversations (56 seats), record breaking 15 to 20 mph at 2200 rpm max, the ice outside, sometimes fog or blizzard…”\nChevreuil contacted museums across America and various NSF personnel, making the case that Ivan was an important artifact of Antarctic history that deserved to live on. Soon he was relieved to hear the news that Ivan had been given an eleventh-hour pardon, and would be shipped not to the scrapyard but instead to Christchurch, New Zealand.\nIt seems that the groundswell of protective nostalgia for Ivan and his legacy at McMurdo helped save him from the scrapper. Especially for people like Chevreuil and Henderson, who caught the tail end of Ivan’s legendary lifespan, Ivan represents an earlier era of Antarctic living, one which is rapidly fading into memory.\n“[Ivan] was a mark of an older time, which I think a lot of people—especially people who had been there for years—had that special connection to, as things at McMurdo changed so much,” Henderson says.\nA community effort saved Ivan from being put up for auction. Instead, the bus will be preserved and shipped to New Zealand. Eli Duke / CC BY-SA 2.0\nWhen Ivan first arrived, McMurdo had a bowling alley, a greenhouse, multiple bars, and an old-school boy’s club culture still very much influenced by the Navy, which only turned over McMurdo operations fully to the NSF in 1993, shortly before Ivan’s arrival.\nThe base has evolved over the years, with new facilities replacing beloved old ones, and certain more casual aspects of life on the ice (such as drunken partying) restricted, due at least in part to the rising awareness, on the ice and off, of McMurdo’s persistent culture of sexual harassment. That kind of change is very much welcome, but material remnants of an older McMurdo are still mourned as they are deprecated, demolished, or consigned to the scrapyard.\nWith Ivan arriving safely in New Zealand last week, at the close of the Antarctic summer season, his devoted riders and drivers from over the years can breathe a sigh of relief. According to a statement by an NSF spokesperson, “Ivan is currently parked in Christchurch while NSF works with partners to determine its long-term home. USAP will continue to use other all-terrain vehicles on the continent to transport personnel.”\nThe rumor among Antarctic workers is that Ivan will likely be displayed at the International Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, but it’s possible he might end up at a museum somewhere else in the world. Either way, Ivan will live on as a beloved part of Antarctic history.\n\n            var bodyViewedPercentageLogger = debounce( function() {\n                  logPercentBelowViewport( $('#article-body'), 'contentViewed' );\n\n                  // Chase campaign: Simple Reach reporting %>\n                  // END Chase campaign\n\n                }, 16);\n\n            $(window).on('scroll resize', bodyViewedPercentageLogger);\n\n            Read next\n\n                Demand for Tiny Plants Is Driving a Poaching Crisis in South Africa\n\n                The Succulent Karoo is home to desert plant species found nowhere else on the planet—criminal networks have been digging them up by the millions.\n\n              busantarcticcarstransportationscience\n\n                    Want to see fewer ads?\n                    Become a Member.\n\n                        Want to see fewer ads?\n                        Become a Member.",

Known for its comfort and distinctive orange-and-white design, Ivan has transported personnel between airfields and research stations since 1994. As rumors of its retirement spread, fans worried it would be scrapped.\n\nIvan is a large, 46-foot bus famous for its slow but steady rides. Despite the arrival of faster vehicles, Ivan remained a beloved staple, evoking nostalgia among those who have ridden it. Its quirky charm included a dent from an early mishap, affectionately named “Charlie’s Folly.”\n\nWhen the time came for Ivan to be retired, concerns arose about its fate. Many feared it would be auctioned off for scrap. However, thanks to the efforts of dedicated fans and workers, Ivan was saved and shipped to Christchurch, New Zealand, instead. While its long-term home is still being decided, it is likely to be displayed at the International Antarctic Centre. Ivan will continue to be cherished as an important piece of Antarctic history.",

will not abuse your data.Grade B — The terms of service are fair towards the user but they could be improved.Grade C — The terms of service are okay but some issues need your consideration.Grade D — The terms of service are very uneven, or there are some important issues that need your attention.Grade E — The terms of service raise very serious concerns.No Grade Yet — Not enough information

Fortunately, this security benefit -- most bugs don't give attackers full control -- can be had for unmodified C/C++ software, without per-application effort. This doesn't require trying to establish memory safety; instead, it is sufficient to eliminate most of the combinatorial ways in which software with corrupted memory can execute. To eliminate these interleavings, there already exist practical compiler and runtime mechanisms that incur little overhead and need no special hardware or platform support. Each of the mechanisms described here is already in production use, at scale, on one or more platforms. By supporting their combined use in development toolchains, the security of all C and C++ software against remote code execution attacks can be rapidly, and dramatically, improved.",

Apart from professional optimists like Steven Pinker, most of us might feel on safer ground with Macbeth’s verdict. The less sanguine view of our past as one damned thing after another is more readily compatible with the currently lamentable state of the world. At the time of writing this piece (early January 2025) it is yet to be announced by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists how close to midnight we currently are on the Doomsday clock. In January of last year the board members of the Bulletin, which includes no less than eight Nobel scientists, judged that we are as close as 90 seconds to self-destruction. The following trends were cited to justify their unnervingly bleak diagnosis of our situation:\nThe war in Ukraine and the widespread and growing reliance on nuclear weapons increase the risk of nuclear escalation. China, Russia and the United States are all spending huge sums to expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals, adding to the ever-present danger of nuclear war through mistake or miscalculation. In 2023, Earth experienced its hottest year on record, and massive floods, wildfires and other climate-related disasters affected millions of people around the world. Meanwhile, rapid and worrisome developments in the life sciences and other disruptive technologies accelerated, while governments made only feeble efforts to control them. (https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/)\nThe Bulletin assures us that ‘the world can be made safer. The Clock can move away from midnight.’ Fair enough, but any honest reckoning with global events in the last twelve months must conclude that the only credible direction the Clock can move is forward and ever closer to our annihilation.\nHow quickly humanity’s fortunes can change. It seems like only the day before yesterday that we convinced ourselves of having reached history’s glorious culmination following the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it communism, and the triumph of Western liberal democracy and its inseparable ally, capitalism. Back then it seemed all that was left to do was iron out the remaining creases in our own infallible political economy and export it to those parts of the planet which had yet to see the neoliberal light.\nIn those halcyon days the Doomsday Clock was set a full seventeen minutes shy of midnight – the members of the Bulletin board joyously declared in 1991 that the revised setting ‘reflects our optimism that we are entering a new era’. Such shallow sunniness proved short-lived however. By the noughties the clock had to be drastically reset following the outbreak of ‘the second nuclear age’ and the belated realisation that our planet is heating up due to our own activities. While things fluctuated a little in the late noughties the clock has drawn consistently nearer to midnight since 2010. One is left asking how close must we get to Armageddon before the Doomsday Bulletin fulfils the aim of one of its founding editors, Eugene Rabinowitch, to finally ‘frighten men into rationality’.\nThe likelihood that we might be frightened into rationality is looking slimmer by the day. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that we may well have passed the point of no return and are already baked into a nightmare of our own making in which the planet will become uninhabitable, and soon. And that’s assuming we don’t blow ourselves up in thermonuclear smithereens before the ‘natural’ end of our days.\nA sobering prospect and one which suggests human history will end in agony rather than neo-liberal ecstasy. But let’s imagine for a moment we have not yet passed the point of no return, and that we convince ourselves of the need to radically change our ways for the good of humanity and the rest of Mother Earth. What does humanity look like when it is frightened into rationality? How would we think and behave in such changed circumstances? All the late Eugene Rabinowitch had to say on the matter was that the Bulletin’s clock ‘is intended to reflect basic changes in the level of continuous danger in which mankind lives in the nuclear age, and will continue living, until society adjusts its basic attitudes and institutions’. That may well be true, but would human society need to undergo a revolution before being prepared to accept and implement these requisite adjustments? And what form would such a revolution have to take? Would it require a clean and violent departure from the status quo or, alternatively, an approach that builds a necessarily radical solution based on the more progressive aspects of our current regime(s)? Is such a global transformation even imaginatively possible, let alone politically and economically feasible? These are hardly idle questions in our currently drastic predicament.\nThere was a time when philosophers produced answers to such large and important questions. Today the vast majority of them don’t take any professional interest in politics while those that do pursue the subject in a way that would appear bizarre to their more capacious and engaged predecessors. Most contemporary academic philosophers tend to focus on a specific branch of the subject, such as the philosophy of mind or the philosophy of language, or on a certain philosopher or school of philosophy, as for example Wittgenstein or existentialism. The idea that philosophy is one integral whole has fallen victim to the professionalisation of the subject as an academic discipline, which means that its practitioners spend their careers studying more and more about less and less. This pattern may have proved pragmatically successful for the business of the university but its effect on philosophy can hardly be viewed as a happy one, even among those of us who don’t entirely buy the idea of some lost golden age when philosophy enjoyed the power to change the world.\nOne of the great long-dead philosophers who emphatically did see philosophy as one and sought to address the defining questions of his day was the German thinker Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Unlike his philosophical predecessors, Hegel argued that history provides the key to answering the riddle of our existence. Before Hegel, philosophers tended to regard humanity as fundamentally unchanging even if they disagreed about what makes human beings tick. Hegel came up with the revolutionary view that not only has human nature transformed radically and irreversibly over time but that this change happens in a particular way and, most strikingly of all, forms part of an underlying and profound purpose. The idea that history is ‘a tale told by an idiot’ was, therefore, anathema to Hegel. He felt there is a discernible and coherent pattern to human history and that it is leading inevitably and progressively via a dialectical process to a final and ultimately happy destination. ‘The history of the world’, he famously declared, ‘is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom.’\nToday, there is a tendency to adopt a Jekyll and Hyde attitude to Hegel’s view of human history. His idea that we are historically conditioned all the way down is quite widely regarded as insightful but his notion that we have been (and presumably still are) travelling ineluctably towards full and free consciousness or Spirit (Geist) is generally dismissed as ludicrous – though politicians are not averse to invoking the Hegelian-like notion of the arc of history when it suits their agenda. The main problem with this prevailing impression of Hegel is that it stops us being curious about his ideas, which are immeasurably more nuanced and instructive than the caricature implies. And that brings us to the work under review, Hegel’s World Revolutions by Richard Bourke.\nBourke enjoys an international reputation as an intellectual historian. Since graduating from University College Dublin and the University of Cambridge, he has held teaching appointments and fellowships at several prestigious academic institutions in Europe and the US and is the current holder of the chair in the history of political thought at the University of Cambridge. During this time he has produced a steady stream of publications, including his own monographs Romantic Discourse and Political Modernity (1993), Peace in Ireland (2013), his seminal Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke (2015) as well as a series of books co-edited with other eminent scholars on an a broad range of topics and themes from popular sovereignty and political judgement to modern Irish history and the political thought of the Irish revolution. At this stage in his career a new book by Bourke must count as something of an intellectual event, and particularly when the subject of his latest offering is a thinker as ambitious and influential as Hegel.\nAnyone who takes on Hegel knows they have their work cut out. He is among the most complex, capacious and ambitious philosophers in the history of Western thought. And unlike other comparable figures in that tradition, such as Plato, Descartes or Hume, his style of writing can be notoriously difficult – indeed one of the more striking aspects of the book is the contrast between Bourke’s consistently clear, exact and clipped style and the frequently obscure, vague and stentorian prose of his subject. As the title of Bourke’s book signals, it is not a synoptic or comprehensive study of Hegel’s thought. Rather it is primarily concerned with the historicism and political philosophy of the nineteenth century thinker and even then in a quite defined way.\nBourke indicates in the book’s preface that his goal is threefold: to explain Hegel’s notion of world revolutions, especially the French Revolution, within the context of his time; secondly, to provide a more discriminating picture of Hegel’s understanding of the historical backdrop of modern European history from which the 1789 world revolution arose; and, finally, to consider the sharply mixed reception of Hegel’s thought in the twentieth century, before confronting the knotty question of the applicability of past political ideas to present concerns.\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of this preface is its opening reference to an alleged malaise afflicting contemporary culture, and especially the academy. Describing this sickness as ‘a posture of suspicion’ that dismisses reason as controlling hubris, freedom as domination, and liberal democracy as an ally of imperialism, Bourke regards the phenomenon as culturally noxious and intellectually unfounded, since it denies the genuine and hard-won accomplishments of human history. More interestingly, he asserts that Hegel is the first thinker to help us to see through the spuriousness of this kind of wholesale rejection of Enlightenment values. This is a topic I shall return to in greater detail below as I think these early remarks prefigure something important about Bourke’s evolving conception of the role and authority an intellectual historian can and should assume.\nThe central focus of the opening two-thirds of the book is Hegel’s philosophy of history, or perhaps more accurately his attempt to provide an authentically historical history of philosophy. This is hardly virgin territory, but what makes Bourke’s treatment original and instructive is that he exposes the superficiality of conventional accounts of the topic. Rather than seeing the onward march of human history as fundamentally seamless, he highlights the fact that Hegel understood history as a far more complex and stumbling affair, in which the path to progress often has to endure going one step forward and four steps back before it eventually accomplishes a net gain. A truer picture of the Hegelian historical dialectic from thesis via antithesis through to synthesis is, therefore, more in the spirit of ‘try again, fail again, fail better’.\nBourke finds this pattern noteworthy for a number of reasons but mostly because it offers a vital corrective to the tendency which indulges the illusion that genuine epochal transformation requires an immediate and complete departure from the one which preceded it. This may seem a distinctly elementary point but it’s quite remarkable how often we allow ourselves to become subject to the myth of starting afresh, which has not infrequently caused untold human suffering. Bourke shows that a close reading of Hegel’s Philosophy of History reveals a far more ambivalent and balanced historical sense which offers a potent antidote not just to the myth of the fresh start but to those who, like Nietzsche and Foucault, adopt an unduly dismissive (or, in Pinker’s case, triumphant) view of our current norms and ideals.\nWhat’s especially striking about Bourke’s treatment is how he widens the familiar frame by examining Hegel’s account of ‘world revolutions’ that preceded the paradigmatic one of the French Revolution. What emerges is a highly erudite and persuasive elucidation and clarification of Hegel’s view of human history that progresses along the lines of a game of snakes and ladders rather than like an elevator that only goes up. One of the more vital lessons from Bourke’s detailed work of exegesis is a recognition of the indispensability of continuity as much as change in the historical process. Indeed the first third of his book brings this important and enduring insight to vivid life by showing how Hegel himself could never have accomplished the intellectual breakthroughs he did without standing on the shoulders of his great predecessor Kant. The detailed and cogent case that Bourke puts forward to show how Hegel had to wrestle with Kant’s epistemological and ethical outlook before he could proceed with formulating his own distinctive and revolutionary world view is one of the most arresting sections in what is a truly impressive work.\nReturning to the matter of Bourke’s view of the purpose of his chosen field of study, he addresses this question in the closing section of the book by asking whether intellectual history should adhere to ‘revivalism’ (seeking to resuscitate past ideas) or ‘historicism’ (accepting the pastness of the past). His account of the recent history of the academic study of intellectual history and its major players is characteristically assured even if it can occasionally give the false impression that the only place where worthwhile intellectual history happens is Cambridge (and its outposts).\nWhat are the key takeaways from Bourke’s assessment of the current state of the discipline? There are roughly two major points that he is keen to make. The first is that the tendency of the founders of the so-called Cambridge school of the history of ideas to assume the role of the moralist by reviving outmoded ideas for present purposes is problematic since it betrays their original and valid historicist impulses. Bourke judges that John Pocock, Quentin Skinner and John Dunn exhibited more wisdom when they focused exclusively on reconstructing the historical identity of past thinkers and their thoughts and left ‘the historical past to the past’. His second and related point is that one of the chief reasons why intellectual historians (and to an extent political theorists) are better off resisting revivalism is because their truer vocation is as diagnosticians rather than moralists. Bourke’s firm preference for adopting a ‘diagnostic’ (as distinct from a ‘prescriptive’) approach is that:\nIt helps us understand the character of political structures as products of earlier constellations of forces. It spurs us to pick apart distinct formations as well as to identify continuities across time. Its first duty is to avoid confusion between these two dimensions. Viewed from this angle, the most important task of contextualization is to highlight the diversity of contexts, not least their lack of homogenous synchronicity. We do not study Hegel to confound his circumstances with our own, but precisely to evaluate discrepancies between past and present. The process might reveal correlations and affinities, or equally it might bring out disparities. As Hegel argued at the beginning of the Science of Logic, there is no merit in cleaving ‘to forms of an earlier culture.’\nStrong stuff! But is he right? I’m not so sure. At least one major problem with Bourke’s bold assertion about the purpose of intellectual history is its historicist purism, maybe even fundamentalism. It’s far from clear why we should think that past ideas that are appropriately updated and adjusted cannot be used for present purposes. Of course, one can appreciate why Hegel believed it was unwise to try to recuperate or adhere to outmoded ideas since crucially he believed that history was on a progressive march forward leading us inexorably to perfect freedom. But given that Hegel’s teleological view of history has long ceased to be (or never was) credible, surely this affects how we might regard the relationship between the past and the present. Indeed one wonders if Hegel would have been prepared to accept Bourke’s austere view of the uses of history if he himself had lost faith in his own historical inevitabilism.\nThere is no need to believe in the myth that we can turn the clock back to insist that there are aspects of our past, even the very distant past of the ancient world, that may be worth reviving. In our current existential condition we need all the help we can muster to stop or at least delay that other clock getting any closer to midnight.\n1/2/2025\nJohnny Lyons lives in Dublin.\n\n    X\n\nDonation amount\n\n                                €1\n\n                                €2\n\n                                €5\n\n                                €10\n\n                                €20\n\n                                €50\n\n                                €100\n\n                                €200\n\n                                €500\n\n                                Other\n\n\t\t\tAmount\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t€\n\nDonation frequency\n\n                    One-time\n\n                    Monthly\n\n                    Annual\n\n            E-mail address\n\n            Cardholder’s name\n\n\t\t\tCard info\n\n\t\t\t\tProve you are a human\n\n\t\tDonate €1\n\n        If you donate and also register with the drb you will enjoy permanent free access to our archive of several thousand essays on reaching €100 in donations.

      "en": "### Summary of \"Talkin’ about a Revolution\" by Johnny Lyons\n\nThe article discusses the current state of human history, contrasting two views: one that sees it as a meaningless series of events, and another that views it as a story of progress. The author references the Doomsday Clock, which indicates the escalating dangers of nuclear war and climate change, suggesting humanity is on a precarious path toward destruction.\n\nHistorically, optimism about human progress peaked after the fall of communism, but since then, global threats have intensified, including nuclear arms races and climate crises. The author questions whether humanity can be compelled to change its destructive behaviors before it's too late and if this change would require a revolutionary shift in society.\n\nPhilosopher Hegel believed that history has a purpose and progresses toward freedom. The article critiques the modern academic focus on narrow philosophical topics, arguing that philosophers should reconnect with broader political and historical questions.\n\nRichard Bourke's book, \"Hegel’s World Revolutions,\" is highlighted for its exploration of Hegel's ideas about history and revolutions. Bourke aims to clarify Hegel's thoughts on historical progress, emphasizing that change often comes in cycles rather than straightforward advancement. He critiques contemporary skepticism towards Enlightenment values and advocates for understanding historical contexts rather than merely reviving past ideas for present use.\n\nIn conclusion, the article highlights the urgent need for humanity to confront its existential threats and consider historical lessons in seeking solutions.",

In some rare cases it might not be possible to commit a patch,\n and at that point there should be a stated reason (e.g. patch overlaps\n with another patch that deprecates it, patch is too widespread to verify\n (suggest breaking into smaller patches), etc).\n\nIf you have any questions, once again the Stardot forum is the best place\n to ask, also, if you're considering a particulaly large change, that\n would affect a large functional area or many files, it might well be\n worth getting some advice from the developers on the forum first,\n incase it overlaps with other development work, or even just a suggestion\n of how to accomplish it in smaller changes.",

The story was part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle, a medieval best seller but few now remain.\n                  There are less than 40 surviving manuscripts of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin, with each one unique since they were individually handwritten by medieval scribes.This latest discovery has been identified as having been written between 1275 and 1315.\n\n                        The inner front cover of the manuscript as it was discovered. Seen here are some of the folds, including flaps and turn-ins, making reading and accessing the text hidden beneath particularly difficult without damaging the material.\n\n                        The inner front cover of the manuscript as it was discovered. Seen here are some of the folds, including flaps and turn-ins, making reading and accessing the text hidden beneath particularly difficult without damaging the material.\n\n                  The manuscript had survived the centuries after being recycled and repurposed in the 1500s as the cover for a property record from Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, owned by the Vanneck family of Heveningham.\n                  It meant the remarkable discovery was folded, torn, and even stitched into the binding of the book - making it almost impossible for Cambridge experts to access it, read it, or confirm its origins.\n                  What followed the discovery has been a ground-breaking collaborative project, showcasing the work of the University Library’s Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory (CHIL) and combining historical scholarship with cutting-edge digital techniques, to unlock the manuscript's long-held secrets - without damaging the unique document.\n\n                A delicate discovery\n\n                  Dr Irène Fabry-Tehranchi, French Specialist in Collections and Academic Liaison at Cambridge University Library, was among those who first recognized the importance of the find.\n\n                    \"It was first thought to be a 14th century story about Sir Gawain but further examination revealed it to be part of the Old French Vulgate Merlin sequel, a different and extremely significant Arthurian text.\"\n\n                  As every manuscript of the period was copied by hand, it means each one is distinctive and reflects the variations introduced by medieval scribes.\n                  This one is believed to belong to the short version of the Vulgate Merlin, and small errors—such as the mistaken use of the name \"Dorilas\" instead of \"Dodalis\"— will help Dr Fabry-Tehranchi and her colleague Nathalie Koble (ENS Paris), to trace its lineage among surviving manuscripts.\n\n                        The outer right cover, photographed in standard conditions as seen by the naked eye, shows the wear and tear sustained over the centuries, including a band of faded text around the middle, crumples and tears.\n\n                        The outer right cover, photographed in standard conditions as seen by the naked eye, shows the wear and tear sustained over the centuries, including a band of faded text around the middle, crumples and tears.\n\n                  The way the manuscript has been carefully executed, with decorated initials in red and blue, gave further clues to its origins and helped indicate that it was produced between the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century.\n                  The text is written in Old French, the language of the court and aristocracy in medieval England following the Norman Conquest and this particular fragment belongs to the genre of Arthurian romances which were intended for a noble audience, including women.\n\n                        The inner cover\n\n                        The inner cover\n\n                  The fragment tells two key episodes from the end of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin. The first part recounts the victory of the Christians against the Saxons at the Battle of Cambénic. It tells of the fight of Gauvain (with his sword Excalibur, his horse Gringalet and his supernatural powers), his brothers, and his father King Loth, against the Saxon Kings Dodalis, Moydas, Oriancés, and Brandalus.\n\n                        The outer left cover and extension\n\n                        The outer left cover and extension\n\n                  The second passage presents a more courtly scene, set on the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, with Merlin appearing at Arthur’s court disguised as a harpist—a moment that highlights his magical abilities and his importance as an advisor to the king.\n\n                      Dr Irène Fabry-Tehranchi holding the rare manuscript before inserting it into the Micro CT scanner in the Department of Zoology.\n\n                      Dr Irène Fabry-Tehranchi holding the rare manuscript before inserting it into the Micro CT scanner in the Department of Zoology.\n\n                      The medieval fragment was discovered in 2019 in this box of court rolls during the re-cataloguing of the manorial and estate records relating to the Vannecks of Heveningham (Suffolk).\n\n                      The medieval fragment was discovered in 2019 in this box of court rolls during the re-cataloguing of the manorial and estate records relating to the Vannecks of Heveningham (Suffolk).\n\n                “While they were rejoicing in the feast, and Kay the seneschal brought the first dish to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, there arrived the most handsome man ever seen in Christian lands. He was wearing a silk tunic girded by a silk harness woven with gold and precious stones which glittered with such brightness that it illuminated the whole room.\"\n                A translation from the Suite Vulgate du Merlin manuscript found at Cambridge University Library\n\n                Innovative digitisation techniques\n\n                Multispectral Imaging: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of the back inner cover\n\n                Multispectral Imaging: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of the back inner cover\n\n                      Sally Kilby (Conservation Department) and Błażej Mikuła (CHIL) carefully photograph inside the folds of the manuscript.\n\n                      Sally Kilby (Conservation Department) and Błażej Mikuła (CHIL) carefully photograph inside the folds of the manuscript.\n\n                      This image, made with Multispectral Imaging and processed using the Minimal Noise Fraction method, brings out annotations on the left-hand side which were invisible to the naked eye, including the stamp ‘Huntingfield’ believed to have been added in the 16th century when the manuscript was repurposed as a binding.\n\n                      This image, made with Multispectral Imaging and processed using the Minimal Noise Fraction method, brings out annotations on the left-hand side which were invisible to the naked eye, including the stamp ‘Huntingfield’ believed to have been added in the 16th century when the manuscript was repurposed as a binding.\n\n                      This image, taken with a Multispectral Imaging camera and processed using the Minimal Noise Fraction method, brought out the band of faded and erased text across the cover, making it readable again.

It was fragile, with tears and folds that made it difficult to handle. Traditional methods of conservation might have involved physically removing the binding to unfold the fragment, but this risked causing irreparable damage.\n                  Instead, the team decided to preserve the fragment in situ, keeping it as an example of 16th-century archival binding practices while using cutting-edge technology to virtually unfold and digitise it.\n\n                    “It’s not just about the text itself, but also about the material artefact. The way it was reused tells us about archival practices in 16th-century England. It’s a piece of history in its own right.”\n                      Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi explaining the importance of preserving the fragment in its original state\n\n                  A multidisciplinary team comprising curators, conservators, and imaging specialists from across the University of Cambridge, including departments such as Archives and Modern Manuscripts, Conservation & Heritage, and Collections and Academic Liaison, all worked together with CHIL to analyse and digitise the fragment.\n                  The methods undertaken by Amélie Deblauwe, Błażej Mikuła and Maciej Pawlikowski from CHIL, with the support of Jennifer Murray from the Library’s Conservation Department, allowed them to unfold the fragment virtually and access hidden parts of the text.\n                  To achieve this, the team undertook:\n                  Multispectral Imaging (MSI) This technique used in CHIL involved capturing the fragment in various wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to infrared. The high-resolution images produced by MSI allowed the team to enhance the readability of the text. Images processed using geospatial software revealed details that were invisible to the naked eye. The fragment had been heavily rubbed and worn from its use as a cover, but MSI helped to bring out the text and highlighted annotations in the margins.\n                  Computed Tomography (CT) scanningConducted with equipment and expertise from the University’s Zoology department, the team used a powerful X-ray scanner—typically used for scanning fossils or skeletons—to virtually penetrate the layers of parchment and uncover hidden structures in the binding. It provided a 3D model of the fragment and its binding and allows researchers to examine the structure of the binding without physically dismantling it. The scan revealed how the fragment had been stitched into the cover, providing insights into 16th-century archival binding techniques.\n\n                      A micro CT scan of the binding structure utilises advanced segmenting structures to separate different materials within the manuscript, such as threads used in the binding. By digitally removing the book and leaving just the thread, the model provides a clearer view, enabling precise viewing and facilitating more accurate research. Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and examine the binding in detail.\n\n                  A CT scanner relies on the difference in density of the material. In this case both materials were the same density. The pages were stitched using thin strips of the same or similar parchment. The team spotted enough gap between the pages and the stitching to record that separation.\n                  3D modelling Industrial scanning techniques created highly detailed virtual models of the fragment, allowing researchers to study its creases, stitching, and folds in remarkable detail.\n\n                      A 3D model of the manuscript. Use your mouse to rotate, zoom, and examine the text in detail.\n\n                  Virtual unfoldingThe fragment’s text was not in a straightforward sequence; parts of it were hidden under folds or stitched into the binding. Using mirrors, prisms, magnets, and other tools, the team at CHIL carefully photographed each section of the fragment. The hundreds of resulting images were then painstakingly reassembled digitally, much like a jigsaw, to create a coherent image of the text. By manipulating the digital images, the team could simulate what the document might look like if it were physically opened.Scroll down to watch the unfolding.\n\n            Virtual opening of the Merlin fragment.

And each of them brought something very important to light. This resulted in the creation of a set of unique digital objects which placed the original fragment in a whole new context and has transformed our understanding of it.”\n\n                  Dr. Fabry-Tehranchi described the process as “like solving a puzzle.” \"If this had been done 30 years ago, the fragment might have been cut, unfolded, and flattened. But today, preserving it in situ gives us a crucial insight into 16th-century archival practices, as well as access to the medieval story itself.\"\n                  A model for the future\n                  Beyond revealing the fragment’s story of Merlin, this project has established a new benchmark for the conservation and digitisation of medieval fragments.\n                  \"This project was not just about unlocking one text—it was about developing a methodology that can be used for other manuscripts. Libraries and archives around the world face similar challenges with fragile fragments embedded in bindings, and our approach provides a model for non-invasive access and study.\"\n                  The discovery has already sparked interest among researchers and conservators, including those at the UK’s National Archives, who are keen to explore how these techniques might be applied to their own collections.\n\n                        Amélie Deblauwe, Chief Photographic Technician, CHIL, using a probe macro lens.

Now, images of deep space from JWST’s Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) have revealed something puzzling: most galaxies rotate in the same direction.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the 263 galaxies studied in a paper published February 17 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society rotate clockwise, while the other one-third rotate counterclockwise.\n\nfreestar.queue.push(function() {freestar.newVideo(\"FreeStarVideoAdContainer\");});“The analysis of the galaxies was done by quantitative analysis of their shapes, but the difference is so obvious that any person looking at the image can see it,\" Lior Shamir, a computer scientist from Kansas State University and sole author of the study, says in a statement. \"There is no need for special skills or knowledge to see that the numbers are different. With the power of the James Webb Space Telescope, anyone can see it.”\n\n      The galaxies identified as rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way.\n\n      Shamir, Lior, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 2025 under CC BY 4.0\n\nThe problem is that astronomers have long posited that galaxies should be evenly split between rotating in one direction or the other, astronomer Dan Weisz from the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with the study, wrote for Astronomy back in 2017. “This stems from the idea that we live in an ‘isotropic’ universe, which means that the universe looks roughly the same in every direction. By extension, galaxies shouldn’t have a preferred direction of spin from our perspective,” he added. According to Shamir, there are two strong potential explanations for this discrepancy.\n\nOne explanation is that the universe came into existence while in rotation. This theory would support what’s known as black hole cosmology: the hypothesis that our universe exists within a black hole that exists within another parent universe. In other words, black holes create universes within themselves, meaning that the black holes in our own universe also lead to other baby universes.\n\n\"A preferred axis in our universe, inherited by the axis of rotation of its parent black hole, might have influenced the rotation dynamics of galaxies, creating the observed clockwise-counterclockwise asymmetry,” Nikodem Poplawski, a theoretical physicist at the University of New Haven who was not involved in the study, tells Space.com’s Robert Lea. \"The discovery by the JWST that galaxies rotate in a preferred direction would support the theory of black holes creating new universes, and I would be extremely excited if these findings are confirmed.”\n\n      The galaxies identified as rotating in the same direction relative to the Milky Way (counterclockwise).\n\n      Shamir, Lior, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 2025 under CC BY 4.0\n\nAnother possible explanation involves the Milky Way’s rotation. Due to an effect called the Doppler shift, astronomers expect galaxies rotating opposite to the Milky Way’s motion to appear brighter, which could explain their overrepresentation in telescopic surveys.\n\n“If that is indeed the case, we will need to re-calibrate our distance measurements for the deep universe,” Shamir explains in the statement. \"The re-calibration of distance measurements can also explain several other unsolved questions in cosmology such as the differences in the expansion rates of the universe and the large galaxies that according to the existing distance measurements are expected to be older than the universe itself.”\n\nIt remains to be seen whether further research will confirm black hole cosmology or that astronomers have been measuring the universe’s expansion incorrectly—or perhaps something else entirely.\n\n      Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\n        Email Powered by Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Privacy Notice / Terms & Conditions)\n\n              Margherita Bassi\n\n              | READ MORE\n\n            Margherita Bassi is afreelancejournalistand trilingual storyteller.

Over the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency, it has become increasingly clear to European leaders that remaining reliant on the United States to underwrite the continent’s security would be a dangerous gamble. Trump’s overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Vice President JD Vance’s public attacks on the domestic policies of European countries, the administration’s imposition of tariffs, and threats to the Danish territory of Greenland have pushed European leaders to begin to think seriously about a future in which the United States—and its nuclear weapons—are no longer the ultimate guarantor of European security.Skepticism about the United States’ willingness to fight a nuclear war on Europe’s behalf long predates Trump. During the Cold War, French President Charles de Gaulle famously questioned whether the United States would “trade New York for Paris.” But the Trump administration’s hostility has given new urgency to Europe’s efforts to provide for its own defense.Nonetheless, for Europe to assume responsibility for its own security is not simply a matter of generating more political will, higher defense budgets, or better coordinated procurement processes. Europe must navigate a strategic trilemma regarding its nuclear options. European leaders have three goals they would like to achieve: credible and effective deterrence against Russia; strategic stability, understood as lower incentives for any state to be the first to use a nuclear weapon; and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons to new states. Unfortunately, Europe cannot achieve them all. In fact, choosing any two makes the third impossible. If Europe chooses strategic stability and nonproliferation, it may not be able to deter Russia. But to fortify its nuclear posture enough for credible deterrence, Europe must either allow new states to acquire the weapons or sacrifice a degree of strategic stability. None of the available choices are ideal. But in the absence of protection from across the Atlantic, Europe would be best served by choosing nonproliferation and credible deterrence. Accepting a level of strategic instability in Europe-Russian relations requires assuming genuine nuclear risks. The alternatives, however, would be even more dangerous.PICK YOUR BATTLEEurope’s first option in the absence of U.S. protection would be to choose a combination of nonproliferation and strategic stability. This would most closely resemble Europe’s current arrangement, albeit without the United States’ commitments. In this scenario, France and the United Kingdom would remain Europe’s only nuclear-armed powers, and no other countries would acquire nuclear weapons. Europe’s two nuclear powers would continue to maintain arsenals primarily dedicated to providing a reliable second-strike capability, rather than offering extensive first-use options.Subscribe to Foreign Affairs This WeekOur editors’ top picks, delivered free to your inbox every Friday.   Sign Up      But in this scenario, Europe’s defense posture against Russia would lack credibility. NATO frontline countries, particularly the Baltic states, are vulnerable to limited Russian incursions. Russia could then hold any territory it acquired by threatening nuclear action against Europe, a tactic known as “aggressive sanctuarization.” Any Russian threats in such a context would be credible, given Russia’s overwhelming advantage over France and the United Kingdom at the substrategic level—nuclear weapons with smaller yields and shorter reach, designed for battlefield use rather than to threaten total annihilation—in terms of both the scale and the diversity of its arsenal. Moscow could deploy such threats of limited nuclear use with the expectation that Europe’s nuclear powers, without the capacity to respond in kind and thus keep the conflict contained, would back down from trying to recover lost territory. In other words, without the U.S. nuclear backstop, picking nonproliferation and strategic stability would come at the expense of Europe’s deterrence credibility.\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile');\n});\nMoreover, this credibility gap is unlikely to be bridged by an increase in European conventional forces, at least not in the near future. Avoiding the dilemma of either yielding to Russian nuclear threats and allowing the loss of NATO territory or risking nuclear escalation in attempting to liberate NATO territory would require conventional defenses capable of halting a Russian incursion at the border. European NATO members, particularly those near Russia, have made significant investments in strengthening their local defenses, including through defense spending increases and plans for deploying troops to frontline countries. But these measures are likely still insufficient to immediately repel a determined Russian attack, especially in the Baltics. A defense force that could do more than simply delaying a Russian assault would involve a substantial increase in troops and a posture comparable in scope and ambition to U.S. forces stationed in West Germany during the Cold War. In principle, such an effort is not impossible, but it would take time and sustained investment, well beyond European countries’ latest short-term increases in defense budgets. Realistically, a credible forward defense posture would likely take seven to ten years—or longer—to establish. And even if leaders could marshal the political will, patience, and funding to scale up defense budgets, the continent’s limited production capacity for key military equipment, combined with manpower constraints in several countries, would pose significant obstacles to rapidly building up forces.Seeking another way to defend itself, Europe could choose nonproliferation and credible deterrence. As in the first scenario, France and the United Kingdom would remain Europe’s only nuclear-armed powers. But to compensate for the gap in conventional capabilities and lower-yield nuclear weapons, Europe would have to rely on extended deterrence provided by its two nuclear states. To deter a Russian attack on frontline states in eastern Europe, however, France and the United Kingdom would need to expand their low-yield, tactical-level nuclear options, and indicate a willingness to use them, including by employing them first. Like the approach taken up by United States and NATO during the Cold War once the Soviet Union gained the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, London and Paris would need to build up their limited nuclear options and develop doctrines that both outline their realistic use in battlefield missions and detail how to manage escalation.Prioritizing nonproliferation and deterrence would thus require abandoning strategic stability. France and the United Kingdom would need to make the possibility of nuclear first use credible, which would necessarily be perceived as threatening by any potential target of such nuclear use. The chance that a crisis could escalate above the nuclear threshold would rise. Indeed, making crises more prone to nuclear escalation in order to deter Russia from initiating them would be the entire purpose of an updated British and French posture.The final option for Europe in the absence of U.S. security guarantees would be to choose credible deterrence and strategic stability, sacrificing the continent’s commitment to nonproliferation. In this scenario, Europe’s nuclear powers would retain nuclear arsenals optimized for retaliation rather than first use, thus maintaining strategic stability. But if a nuclear posture geared toward retaliation is to offer credible deterrence against Russian conventional or limited nuclear threats, the weapons need to be under the control of states for which Russian military action would pose an existential threat, not just France and the United Kingdom, which, by virtue of their distance from Russia, do not face the same risk as those on the frontline. Because neither country’s existence would be in danger, their ability to credibly threaten a nuclear response would be limited. For the eastern European country targeted, however, a Russian conventional or nuclear attack would constitute an immediate and existential threat, and Moscow would have to fear that country would use its nuclear weapons, if it had them. In other words, maintaining both credible deterrence and strategic stability requires proliferation: eastern European countries would need to have their own nuclear arsenals to deter Russia from attacking.FINDING UNSTABLE GROUNDAllowing proliferation in Europe by choosing strategic stability and credible deterrence would be highly costly, however, making it the least attractive of the three options. European states acquiring nuclear weapons could well deal a deathblow to the Nonproliferation Treaty, an international accord that took effect in 1970, and the global effort to stop the spread of these weapons. Moreover, proliferation is an arduous and dangerous process. It would be logistically difficult for countries such as Poland to acquire nuclear capabilities quickly because they lack suitable civilian nuclear infrastructure to divert to a nuclear weapons program. The proliferation process would therefore involve a long period of instability, as Russia would have an incentive to take preventive military action to stop frontline European states acquiring the weapons to deter it.Forgoing credible deterrence against Russia by choosing strategic stability and nonproliferation might be the most politically expedient choice for European leaders, since it would not require major shifts in doctrine or investments in defense. If European leaders defer their decision on the future of the continent’s nuclear policy (or find themselves caught off-guard by an abrupt but now plausible U.S. departure from Europe), they might have no other choice but to accept this trade. But making the easiest decision would still be a dangerous gamble. Europe would have to hope that Russia would not call its bluff by seizing European territory with conventional forces and nuclear threats, either for the sake of Putin’s expansionist ambitions or to attempt to shatter the NATO alliance once and for all. Western European leaders would also be betting that their vulnerable eastern European counterparts would not seek their own nuclear weapons to protect themselves, which would trigger all the disadvantages and costs associated with proliferation.The danger in sacrificing credible deterrence is that Europe would be left relying on Russian restraint, a potentially catastrophic choice given Moscow’s track record of invading its neighbors. As a result, some version of British or French extended nuclear deterrence may ultimately prove most attractive. It would provide a plausible path to deterrence without the political costs and security risks of proliferation, and could be put into place relatively quickly if Paris and London are willing to act decisively. The associated costs would be manageable, particularly when compared to the hundreds of billions currently allocated to Europe’s conventional rearmament. Although the risk of a nuclear first strike Europe would increase, it would remain containable, especially if France and Britain developed new doctrines that signaled their resolve below the threshold of nuclear use. Just as in the Cold War, when Washington decided to include its allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella rather than allow them all to nuclearize or leave them to fend for themselves, extended deterrence looks a better bet than the alternatives.\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\ngoogletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--2');\n});\n Europe has no way out of its strategic trilemma that does not involve painful tradeoffs.Still, relying on Europe’s two nuclear powers to fill the void left by the United States is not an easy task. Neither country’s nuclear arsenal is currently positioned to assume the full array of functions that U.S. nuclear forces provide. In the event of nuclear war with Russia, France and the United Kingdom would be unable to minimize the damage to Europe. They can offer retaliation on a European country’s behalf, but not preemptive action that could head off a strike on European cities and populations. With limited arsenals, particularly when it comes to low-yield weapons that can be used to push Russia back rather than escalate, they also lack the flexibility to counter Russian threats that fall below the level of total annihilation. Both countries have relied on ambiguity in their nuclear strategies, avoiding rigid commitments on the exact conditions of nuclear weapons use to keep adversaries uncertain. This approach may have been effective when their arsenals were solely focused on homeland defense, but it is unlikely to reassure allies that would depend on these nuclear forces for their defense.Making a strategy of European extended deterrence work will require significant updates to both nuclear hardware and doctrines. Amending their doctrines would be a comparatively quick process. British and French leaders could at any point publicly declare that they are prepared to prevent the conventional defeat of their eastern European allies, even if it requires being the first party to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. But France and the United Kingdom would need to increase the scale and diversity of their nuclear arsenals, likely a multiyear undertaking even for France, which has preserved much of the necessary infrastructure. Leaders would also have to sell this strategy at home—which may prove difficult, especially in France. Marine Le Pen, leader of the opposition National Rally party, has already stated her opposition to a French nuclear umbrella and could reverse any changes if she came to power in the country’s 2027 presidential election.If London and Paris can overcome these hurdles, offering effective extended deterrence to vulnerable eastern European countries may be feasible. The version of extended deterrence they could offer would still be riskier and more fragile than what the United States has offered since the early days of the Cold War. But ultimately, Europe has no way out of its strategic trilemma that does not involve painful tradeoffs. It is therefore no surprise that European leaders have thus far avoided making plans for the continent’s post-American defense. Yet with the future of the continent at stake, Europe is better off acting than not, even if that means accepting the costs associated with the least-bad option.Loading...<span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>You are reading a free article Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.

European leaders are realizing that depending on the U.S. for security, especially with changing political dynamics, is risky. They aim to achieve three goals: effective deterrence against Russia, strategic stability (reducing the incentive for nuclear first use), and controlling the spread of nuclear weapons. However, they cannot accomplish all three simultaneously.\n\n1. **Trilemma**: Europe must choose two of the three goals, leading to difficult trade-offs:\n   - **Option 1**: Nonproliferation and strategic stability, but this weakens deterrence against Russia.\n   - **Option 2**: Nonproliferation and credible deterrence, leading to the possibility of nuclear first use, increasing nuclear escalation risks.\n   - **Option 3**: Credible deterrence and strategic stability, which requires new nuclear states in Eastern Europe, undermining nonproliferation efforts.\n\n2. **Current Situation**: Without U.S. support, Europe's nuclear powers (France and the UK) may not effectively deter Russia. Their current arsenals are not designed for rapid response or low-yield tactical use, which could leave frontline countries vulnerable.\n\n3. **Extended Deterrence**: The authors suggest that a strategy of extended deterrence, where France and the UK offer nuclear protection to Eastern Europe, is preferable to proliferation. This requires updating their nuclear capabilities and doctrines, which may face political challenges domestically.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Europe must navigate these strategic choices carefully, as failing to act could lead to dangerous consequences.

We designed and used deep learning recurrent neural network transducer models to achieve online large-vocabulary intelligible fluent speech synthesis personalized to the participant’s preinjury voice with neural decoding in 80-ms increments. Offline, the models demonstrated implicit speech detection capabilities and could continuously decode speech indefinitely, enabling uninterrupted use of the decoder and further increasing speed. Our framework also successfully generalized to other silent-speech interfaces, including single-unit recordings and electromyography. Our findings introduce a speech-neuroprosthetic paradigm to restore naturalistic spoken communication to people with paralysis.\n\n                        Access through your institution\n\n                        Buy or subscribe\n\n                        This is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\n\n                Access options\n\n                        Access through your institution\n\n    /* style specs start */\n\n/* style specs end */\n\n        Access Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\n\n        Get Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n\n          24,99€ /30days\n\n        cancel any time\n\n        Learn more\n\n    Subscription info for Korean customersWe have a dedicated website for our Korean customers.

A large acoustic language model (HuBERT) encodes the audio waveforms into acoustic-speech units to be used as targets during training. Similarly, a byte-pair encoding model encodes the sentences into word and subword units. Speech unit For the speech-synthesizer component, a voice conversion module (YourTTS) is used to convert the audio into personalized audio conditioned on a short clip from the participant recorded in passing before her loss of speech. (Bottom) High-gamma and low-frequency neural signals are extracted during inference, and 80-ms chunks are fed into the multimodal neural encoder. The language model predictions are joined with the neural encoder outputs. For acoustic-speech units, a duration predictor predicts the acoustic-speech unit duration and duplicates the unit accordingly. The speech synthesizer then vocodes the most recent predicted acoustic-speech unit into an 80 ms audio chunk.Extended Data Fig. 2 Real-time incremental text-to-speech decoding performance.Decoding accuracy for real-time text-to-speech decoding using the 1024-word-General sentence set. a. Phoneme error rates. b. Word error rates. c. Character error rates. a-c. Instead of directly synthesizing speech, a text-to-speech model was used to incrementally synthesize the next word or sub-phrase in the predicted sentence. Chance distributions were generated by shuffling the electrode locations and applying the decoder. Predicted speech transcripts were obtained via the Whisper automatic speech recognition model57. For speech, we observed a median PER of 33.0% (99% CI [26.3, 51.5]). Median WER was 40.8% (99% CI [35.3, 62.7]), and median CER was 30.9% (99% CI [29.4, 50.0]). We observed a median PER of 23.1% (99% CI [15.2, 28.5]) for text. Median WER was 30.7% (99% CI [19.2, 40.0]), and median CER was 24.7% (99% CI [14.1, 28.0]). Performances were significantly better than chance (*P < 0.05 for all metrics, Wilcoxon signed-rank test with 6-way Holm-Bonferonni Correction for multiple comparisons). Statistics compare n = 10 total pseudo-blocks.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 3 GO cue to speech-decoding latency.Full distribution of latencies calculated by taking the time difference between the speech or text onset and the GO cue. For the 1024-word-General set, we achieved median latencies of 1.67 s (99% CI [1.57, 1.81]) for speech synthesis and 1.56 s (99% CI [1.4, 1.56]) for text decoding, respectively. For the 50-phrase-AAC set, we achieved median latencies of 2.61 s (99% CI [2.53, 2.7]) for speech synthesis and 2.90 s (99% CI [2.7, 2.9]) for text decoding, respectively. The dashed line denotes previous state-of-the-art speech-synthesis BCI latency in a person with paralysis. For synthesis, n = 144 and n = 98 trials for the 50-phrase-AAC set and 1024-word-General set, respectively, and for text, n = 150 and n = 100 trials for the 50-phrase-AAC set and 1024-word-General set, respectively. The white dot represents the median, the box spans the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extend to +/− 1.5 times the interquartile range, and the violin width illustrates data density at each point on the y-axis.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 4 Characterization of inference latency.Characterization of the latency of the speech synthesis and text decoding system. Offline, we re-applied the decoder to the real-time test trials (30 re-applications for each of the 100 trials of the 1024-general sentence set). We measured the latency of the inference procedure at each time step. a. Latency per time step for the neural encoder (n = 300 decoded outputs; line and shading indicate mean and +/− standard deviation, respectively), speech joiner and beam search, speech synthesizer, and text joiner and beam search. Each module is reported in a separate panel. b. Success rate averaged across time for all trials. Measured by the ratio of the entire system inference below 80 ms latency, we observed a success rate of 99.3% (99% CI [97.60, 99.73]).Source dataExtended Data Fig. 5 Speech synthesis performance on unseen words.The confusion matrix presents the hierarchically clustered results of a 20-fold cross-validated classification using a random forest classifier on spectrograms extracted from decoded waveforms corresponding to 744 trials across 25 blocks of the participant miming one of 26 unseen words from the NATO phonetic alphabet (for example, ‘Alpha,’ ‘Bravo,’ ‘Charlie,’ etc.). The task aimed to test the generalizability of our 1024-word speech synthesis model to unseen words, preventing the language model from using context by isolating the words. The model achieved a median accuracy of 46.0% (99% CI [37.0, 55.4]; bootstrapped over 1,000 iterations), which was significantly above the 3.85% chance level (P < 0.001, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Hierarchical clustering was applied, with darker cells along the diagonal indicating higher classification accuracy. All results were computed offline. The words ‘Hotel’ and ‘Mike’ were excluded to ensure a fair generalization analysis as they were part of the training set. Decoded example waveforms are provided in Supplementary Audio 1.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 6 Emission lattice visualization for 50-phrase-AAC set trial.Visualization of an emission sequence for a trial from the 50-phrase-AAC set real-time trials. (Top) For an example trial, the likelihoods of emitting acoustic speech unit sequences are shown time aligned with the detected speech onset, illustrating how the model selects the most probable speech unit sequences over time based on the input neural data. (Bottom) Same as the acoustic-unit lattice, but for text encodings. The decoded word is time-aligned to when it is most probable. The 50-phrase-AAC set tended to have an increased latency and staggered emissions compared with 1024-word-General set due to the stronger language model prior.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 7 Streaming speech synthesis latency and speed during long-form unstructured silent-speech.Offline speed performances during unstructured silent-speech. To evaluate system benefits during freeform expression, using the 1024-word-General sentence set model, offline, we applied the decoder to four unprompted freeform blocks where the participant attempted silent speech. Neural data was continuously fed into the RNN-T model throughout each block, following the same procedure as Fig. 3 (long-form copy-typing), but applied to unstructured freeform silent-speech attempts. The results were compared against the delayed synthesis approach, where detected speech windows were processed before synthesizing speech. a.

Phoneme error rates. b. Word error rates. c. Character error rates. a-c. For speech, ASR on the synthesized speech was used for measuring the error rates. In all metrics, no significant difference was observed for ablating PrCG, PoCG, or TG, however, the accuracies significantly dropped by ablating entire motor regions (both PrCG and PoCG; **P < 0.01, ns > 0.05, Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test with 3-way Holm-Bonferonni Correction for multiple comparisons). For speech, P = 1.00 for excluding PrCG or PoCG; P = 0.194 for excluding TG; P = 0.00586 for excluding PrCG and PoCG. For text, P = 1.00 for excluding PoCG or TG; P = 0.194 for excluding PrCG; P = 0.00586 for excluding PrCG and PoCG. n = 10 pseudo-blocks for each box depicted.

Word error rates. c. Character error rates. ASR on the synthesized speech was used to measure the error rates for speech synthesis. Significant gains were observed in all metrics between 8.6 hours and 29.4 hours of training data, but no significant difference exists between 29.4 hours and 58.4 hours of training data (n = 10 pseudo-blocks; **P < 0.01, ns > 0.05; 3-Way Holm-Bonferonni Correction for multiple comparisons). For speech, P = 1.00 for comparing 58.4 hours and 29.4 hours; P = 0.00586 for 29.4 hours and 8.6 hours. For text, P = 0.580 for comparing 58.4 hours and 29.4 hours; P = 0.00586 for 29.4 hours and 8.6 hours.Source dataExtended Data Table 1 Illustrative text-decoding examplesFull size tableSupplementary informationSupplementary InformationSupplementary Notes 1 and 2, Methods 1–3, Fig. 1, Tables 1–12, References, the current clinical trial protocol and the original clinical trial protocol.Reporting SummarySupplementary Video 1A demonstration of online naturalistic streaming speech synthesis with synchronized text decoding from brain activity. In this task, the participant silently attempts to say sentences from the 1,024-word-General sentence set. Once the sentence in white turns green, she attempts to say it silently. Meanwhile, neural data are streamed to a joint speech synthesis and text-decoding model. This model emits acoustic speech units and text encodings at 80-ms increments, which are then simultaneously synthesized into personalized speech and decoded text. The audio is streamed in tandem with her silent-speech attempts; meanwhile, the predicted phrase is displayed on the monitor.Supplementary Video 2A demonstration of online streaming text-decoding and incremental TTS synthesis from brain activity. The same paradigm is used as in Supplementary Video 1, except the speech synthesizer is turned off. Instead, once the text decoder predicts a new word, an incremental TTS model synthesizes and plays the new word.Supplementary Audio 1Example decoded waveforms from brain activity during silent-speech attempts of unseen words. For each word, exemplar audio is first played, and then the decoded waveform is played afterward. Offline, to obtain the waveforms, we applied the same model for real-time 1,024-word-General sentence set speech synthesis used for Supplementary Video 1.Source dataSource Data Fig. 1Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 2Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 3Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 4Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 5Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 2Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 3Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 4Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 5Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 6Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 7Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 8Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 9Statistical source data.Rights and permissionsSpringer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.Reprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleLittlejohn, K.T., Cho, C.J., Liu, J.R. et al.

      "en": "**Summary of Technical Report on Brain-to-Voice Neuroprosthesis**\n\nPublished on March 31, 2025, this report presents a new technology aimed at helping individuals with severe paralysis communicate more naturally. The study focuses on a brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis that uses high-density recordings from the brain's speech areas to generate speech in real-time.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Communication Challenges**: People with paralysis often face difficulties in speaking, leading to feelings of isolation. Traditional communication methods can create delays that disrupt natural conversation.\n\n2. **Innovative Approach**: The research involved a participant with severe paralysis who utilized a speech synthesizer that continuously decoded brain activity into speech. This system operated in small increments (80 milliseconds), allowing for near-instantaneous communication.\n\n3. **Deep Learning Technology**: The team developed advanced deep learning models that personalized speech synthesis to match the participant's voice prior to their injury. This system could also detect silent speech, enabling users to communicate without audible speech.\n\n4. **Versatile Applications**: The neuroprosthesis was not only effective for the participant but also showed potential to work with other silent-speech methods, such as muscle signals and different recording techniques.\n\n5. **Significance**: This research marks a significant advancement in assistive communication technology, providing a potential solution for restoring naturalistic speech to those unable to speak due to paralysis.\n\nOverall, this study illustrates a promising step toward improving the lives of individuals with speech impairments through innovative neuroprosthetic technology.",

And then you say what I’m going to do is I’m going to go through and try and block each and put a finger in each hole in the dyke,” he said.\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"http://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MixCollage-27-Oct-2024-08-52-PM-9488-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-49628\" srcset=\"https://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MixCollage-27-Oct-2024-08-52-PM-9488-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MixCollage-27-Oct-2024-08-52-PM-9488-300x158.jpg 300w, https://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MixCollage-27-Oct-2024-08-52-PM-9488-768x403.jpg 768w, https://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MixCollage-27-Oct-2024-08-52-PM-9488.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n\n“It’s just no way. We know that’s not how you design software. You design it so you have some kind of guarantees. Suppose you have a car and it’s all full of little holes and rusty. And you want to sell it. What you do is you do a paint job. That’s what our RLHF is, a paint job,” he added.\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a machine learning technique that helps build artificial intelligence (AI) models by integrating human feedback into the training process. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning, where AI agents learn through predefined reward functions, RLHF incorporates human preferences to refine the model’s behavior. This approach involves training a reward model using human evaluations of AI-generated outputs, which is then employed to optimize the AI’s decision-making. RLHF is particularly effective for complex tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP), where aligning AI outputs with nuanced human goals—like humor or factual accuracy—is challenging to define algorithmically.\n\nHinton’s critique suggests that RLHF is a superficial fix, addressing surface-level issues without solving the underlying problems. He argues that instead of patching individual flaws in a fundamentally broken system, the focus should be on designing AI systems with inherent guarantees of safety and reliability. The “gazillions of bugs” he refers to might include biases, inaccuracies, and unpredictable behaviors that emerge from the complexity of these models. The “paint job” of RLHF, in his view, merely masks these flaws without addressing the underlying rot.\n\nThis critique carries significant weight coming from someone of Hinton’s stature. He is one of the pioneers of Deep Learning, and won the Nobel Prize in 2024 for his contributions. Hinton’s critique highlights a growing concern within the AI community: that the current trajectory of AI development, while producing impressive results, might be building upon a shaky foundation. Meta’s AI Chief Yann LeCun has also been regularly saying that current AI approaches will not necessarily be able to model human intelligence, and will eventually plateau in capabilities. It remains how AI progress unfolds, but there are several dissenting voices which say that current techniques won’t get us very far.\nShareTweet\n\n\t\tPosted in AI",

I get a real buzz rediscovering something like this after more than 30 years have passed.\n\nIt’s a sweet little point and click adventure game for Classic Macintosh called “Station: Travel Through the Four Seasons” by Mitsuo Isaka, about taking train rides through the Japanese countryside. You meet and interact with a variety of people and explore each scene to figure out how to move on.\n\nIt was found on CD2 マルチメディアチャレンジ ’94 要賞作品篥 (Multimedia Challenge ’94 Award Winning Works) of MACLIFE Special: Gokuraku Paradise Theater 1994. You can download the ISO to explore that disc for yourself in an emulator or on a vintage Macintosh. I also uploaded just the game to Macintosh Garden so that you don’t need to download the whole CD for just this game.\n\nPlay it in your browser\n\nBut if you want to try it right now you can do so in your browser thanks to the Infinite Mac website, using this link: KanjiTalk 7.5.3 with the Station disk image already mounted\n\nThe game is in Japanese and features mostly voiceover and a little on screen text. Google Translate can probably help with its conversation (audio) and camera (visual) translation modes. Ganbare!\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Japanese, it says:\n\n  ここは“四季の里”といわれるとこる。昔から一両だけのディーゼル車がのんびりと走っているという。\n\n  駅は全部で四つの小さな鉄道だけれど不思議なことに、ひとつひとつの駅にそれぞれのきまった季節があるという。\n\n  ぼくは、さっそくその鉄道に乗ってみようと春の季節をもっといわれる“桜ヶ丘”という駅を訪ねることにした・・・\n\nTranslated into English:\n\n  This place is known as the ‘Village of the Four Seasons’. A single diesel train has been running slowly and leisurely here for a long time.\n\n  There are four stations in total on this small railway, but strangely enough, each station has its own set season.\n\n  I decided to visit a station called ‘Sakuragaoka’, which is known more for its spring season, to try out the railway…\n\n.carousel__holder {width: 100%; position: relative;

To maximize returns on our donors’ funds and decrease systematic bias, we hire content writers from countries  underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.\n\nOur processes are public. Our work is transparent. Our freelancers have a high-level of autonomy. We are based in Switzerland and recognized as a tax-exempt organization with a public utility purpose.\n\nWikipedia was mostly written by volunteers. But sometimes they need a bit of help.\n\nSo far, we have created 2,200+ new articles on Wikipedia, which generate 8m views per year.\n\nWhat makes us different\n\nWikipedia relies entirely on volunteers to create and maintain its content. That often works well, but there are tasks that volunteers don’t enjoy doing, and topics where volunteers are missing.\n\nFor example, articles in topics such as Science, technology, engineering, and Finance are lacking compared to topics such as History, Geography, and Humanities. Content from non-anglophone countries is underrepresented. Hundreds of thousands of high-quality articles are not translated.\n\nWith targeted funding, these opportunities can be addressed for high impact with very limited costs.\n\nBut even when paid, Wikipedia editors need to enjoy what they do. Otherwise quality suffers. That’s why we strive to provide as much autonomy and ownership to our freelancers as possible, just like regular volunteers. They use their own account for all edits, and are responsible to maintain the articles they create.\n\nWhere we focus\n\nWe currently prioritize translations over new content, which requires significantly less time to achieve similar results. We leverage Machine Learning tools for initial drafts to minimize manual work.\n\nWe concentrate on the English, Spanish and Portuguese Wikipedia to reach larger audiences.

    "content": "AuthenticationWhy Login Failures MatterBy Hannah SutorPicture a chart representing user logins. It has a line, trending upwards and to the right. Growing over time, never dipping.When you care about providing great authentication experiences, like us (the few, the proud), there is nothing better than this chart - undeniable proof that our users are successfully logging in. And, more importantly, getting access to the features or data which that login process protects. That’s what most users are looking for, after all.The more people who successfully log in, the more confident we are that our solution can handle a large number of users and that users are able to enter the application smoothly.However, do you track login failures as much as you pay attention to login successes? At first,it doesn’t sound as exciting. You definitely won’t be hoping for a line up and to the right. Instead, you’ll be hoping for a line trending downwards. Or better yet, one never ascending in the first place.Tracking login failure rates is just as important, if not more important, than tracking login success numbers. Failures signify users are having difficulty accessing the application, and it’s our job to figure out why. And to fix it.Define Login FailuresBefore you can measure, you have to decide on what you will consider a failure in the login process. A safe assumption is that any failed authentication event should be counted. Authentication is not as simple as a username and password pair, and scenarios around passwordless authentication and multi-factor authentication (MFA) need to be considered as well. If a user attempts to log in, uses their username/password pair successfully, but never completes MFA, this is considered a failure.There are some scenarios that are not quite failures, and not quite successes. These are also worth tracking, but require some nuance in instrumentation and reporting. Some examples:User initiates an account recovery flow, but never completes it.A magic link email or SMS is sent, but never completed.If MFA is required, and user removes the current factor, but never adds another factor.A user was rate limited after suspicious behavior or for entering their credentials incorrectly.In all cases, the user is denied access to the application, but not in a typical manner. If you aren’t tracking login failures at all, don’t worry about these edge cases. But if you are and want to take the next step in terms of understanding your user’s experience, track these and think about how your user might perceive them.Measuring Login Failure RatesThe first step in working towards measuring failed authentication attempts is awareness - brought to you by this article!Next, walk through what you should be doing::Begin logging login activity, if you aren’t already. Both successes and failures must be measured to understand the average login success ratio and the trend over time. Here are some common ways to capture this data:FusionAuth’s login failure webhook fires an event when a login fails due to invalid credentialsOkta gives admins access to a report that contains failed login informationAuth0 provides events that give specific reasons why a login failedIf you are using another provider, consult the documentationIf you’re using a homegrown identity management system, make sure it includes login failure events and metadata around themBe granular. When a failure occurs, log the reason for the failure and metadata around the event. If you can’t piece together a hypothesis about the failure, you can’t fix it, so this part is really important. Some ideas for attributes to track:User attributes: IP address, user agent/OS, the mapped location of the IP address, time of day, type of login (social sign on, WebAuthn, magic link), which factor failed (if using multi-factor authentication aka MFA)System level events: application version, client version, external factor such as a new source of traffic or promotionRemember that an incomplete login should also count as a failure - track these too!Patience is key. You’ll need at least 3 months of solid data before you can start to zoom in to identify meaningful trends.Adjust your expectations based on your industry. While it is difficult to find login failure rates based on your specific industry, they can range between 15-40%, based on the average of the stats between this article and this one. After tracking these numbers for a while, you’ll get a feel for when changes to your applications cause failure rates to change.Pass it on. When building your application, empower application administrators to monitor failure rates themselves. For example, Okta gives admins a report where they can view failures and successes. Most authentication as a service providers offer detailed log events that can be built as a dashboard or report for administrator consumption.Now that you know what you should be doing to track failures, let’s talk about why user authentication events fail.Why Logins FailThere are a number of reasons why someone fails to log in. These range from system issues like performance to user confusion to obstacles from security measures.PerformanceTechnical problems, such as slow response times from the application, cause major user attrition. A report by Google found that 53% of mobile users will leave a website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. Even if your application loads within a reasonable amount of time, you need to ensure that your login response is equally as zippy.Poor UXA poor user experience, often marked by unclear instructions and an overwhelming number of input fields, can cause frustration for users and lead to authentication failure. Poor UX can manifest in other ways, too:Not providing an easy way to reset forgotten or lost passwords. When there is no clear way to reset a password or recover a username, users will quickly give up and exit the login flow. Give the user the option to resend recovery emails, and remind them to check spam folders.Inconsistent field lengths. When a new user registration form accepts a certain number of characters for the password field, and the login form accepts a different, smaller number, your user can be locked out even if they have correct credentials! Be sure that your field lengths are consistent for each field type, no matter where they are presented.Lack of tools for MFA recovery. Don’t forget that many accounts have MFA (we hope). Focusing only on username and password recovery leaves users who have lost their MFA devices unable to access their accounts. Simplify MFA recovery by forcing users to download recovery codes when they first set up MFA.Lack of feedback in the UI. Rather than wait for a user to submit the login form, validate and alert them of errors in real-time so that users can correct them quickly rather than wait until they submit the form.Security MeasuresAh, the age old struggle between security and usability. Those same security features that help to project our application also cause friction for users. A CAPTCHA may make sense if a user is logging in from an unusual IP address, but presents an additional obstacle to the user.A common security measure is to make a user click a magic link, sent to them via email or SMS, when a login looks suspicious. Any time a user has to go into another application (in this case, their email client or phone), just to use yours, they are at a higher risk of failed authentication.Unnecessary steps in the flow for security purposes will slow down the login process, leading to a higher chance of user attrition and error. Choose security measures wisely.An additional benefit of taking a baseline measurement as this article suggests above is that you can know how such measures affect your users.User ProblemsYou may do all you can to make the login process seamless for users, but failed attempts are a part of life. Why is that?On the other end of your shiny, awesome login form, is a flawed human being. We forget our credentials. We forget if we used Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn to sign in. We entered our username, then got distracted and forgot to come back to the tab.I could go on and on. Ultimately, expect that no matter how optimized your login process, there will be some percentage of failure due to the human condition.Why Be Aware?You might ask, why do I care about login failures?An authenticated user is more valuable to your business than an unauthenticated one. Once a user is tied to an identity, you can improve their experience:You can personalize your application for them, lowering time to value.You can contact them if something goes wrong, or to nudge them back into your product.Authenticated users are much more likely to share valuable private data with your application by engaging with it.When you improve the percentage of successful logins, you are directly creating business value.Authentication is a high stakes, high visibility portion of your application. If a user can’t login, the application is dead in the water. When users can’t log in, they lose trust in your application - not to mention the general sense of annoyance that comes with wanting to access something that you can’t!Alerting on login failure rates can give you a heads up that something isn’t right. The sooner you know, the sooner you can do something about it.Choosing Not To Invest In Login Failure RatesAll things in software (and life) have tradeoffs, and tracking login failures is no exception. You may choose not to invest in this area for the following reasons:Other priorities with higher ROI: You’ve done the work to understand what a failed login attempt costs your company, and you’ve determined that there are bigger fish to fry.You’ve hit “good enough”: There comes a point where you are no longer willing to invest in optimizing your login experience. Even if you had data pointing to issues, you wouldn’t do anything about it.Take ActionOnce you implement tracking, you may determine that you want to do something to improve your login failure rates. Here are some ideas for how to increase successful logins.Provide automated help to anyone struggling to log in. Present tailored advice or reminders in the user experience based on the problem they’re experiencing. An example of this is offering to send a password reset email with one click after a certain number of failed login attempts. Or, if you’re noticing that legitimate-looking users are failing at the CAPTCHA step frequently, consider a CAPTCHA alternative.Give secure options for account credentials reset. Once a problem has been detected, offer a login with a security code. Once the user is authenticated, allow them to modify their credentials so that they can remember them. For an added layer of security, send the user an email any time their username or password changes. In case it wasn’t them, they can be alerted of a possible malicious actor and take further steps such as changing their credentials or locking their account.Give users options. Passwordless options, like passkeys and magic links, can replace username and password combinations. You can also provide the ability for users to authenticate with pre-existing accounts using social sign in, SAML, and OAuth2. Since you have metrics captured, you can determine which of these is most effective for your userbase.Keep users logged in if they choose. Ensure your authentication system provides the ability for users to select “Remember me”. Long lived sessions reduce the need to log in, sometimes at the expense of security (tradeoffs, remember!). Administrators choose the maximum length of valid sessions before a user is forced to authenticate again. Here you’ll want to again balance between ease of use and security.In ConclusionIn the case of login failures, knowledge is power. Instrument your current login success and failure rates with granular data about each outcome. Understand why users are failing to authenticate, and take action accordingly.Doing so will lead to the positive business outcomes associated with authenticated users, and maybe some beautiful looking charts, too.",

    "content": "A potential supply chain attack on GitHub CodeQL started simply: a publicly exposed secret, valid for 1.022 seconds at a time.\n\nIn that second, an attacker could take a series of steps that would allow them to execute code within a GitHub Actions workflow in most repositories using CodeQL, GitHub’s code analysis engine trusted by hundreds of thousands of repositories. The impact would reach both public GitHub (GitHub Cloud) and GitHub Enterprise.\n\nIf backdooring GitHub Actions sounds familiar, that’s because it’s exactly what threat actors did in the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack. Imagine that very same supply chain attack, but instead of backdooring actions in tj-actions, they backdoored actions in GitHub CodeQL.\n\nAn attacker could use this to:\n\nCompromise intellectual property by exfiltrating the source code of private repositories using CodeQL.\n\nSteal credentials within GitHub Actions secrets of workflow jobs using CodeQL and leverage those secrets to execute further supply chain attacks.\n\nExecute code on internal infrastructure running CodeQL workflows.\n\nCompromise GitHub Actions secrets of workflows using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL.\n\nThis is the story of how we uncovered an exposed secret leading to a race condition, a potential supply chain attack, and CVE-2025-24362.\n\nNote: Per GitHub’s advisory, they have found no evidence of compromise to its platform or systems.\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\n\nIn January 2025, I took a break from Praetorian’s Red Team and began three months of research. I aimed to push the limits of public GitHub Actions exploitation, building on presentations we’ve given at Black Hat, DEF CON, Schmoocon, and Black Hat Arsenal. Tools and takeaways from this research will be implemented in our CI/CD Professional Services Engagements, and into Chariot, our Continuous Threat Exposure Management platform.\n\nI began my research rotation by scanning GitHub Actions workflow artifacts for secrets.\n\nSecret Scanning\n\nIn August 2024, Palo Alto researcher Yaron Avital published an article about identifying secrets in workflow artifacts. I had a hunch that there were still secrets to be found, especially since there hadn’t been much public follow-up work since the article.\n\nI built a simple Actions Artifacts Secret Scanner to get started. It downloads artifacts from GitHub Actions workflows, recursively extracts their contents, and scans their contents for secrets with Nosey Parker, Praetorian’s open-sourced secrets scanning tool.\n\nThe Actions Artifacts Secret Scanner has been integrated into Chariot and open-sourced as a Gato capability.\n\nAfter running this scanner for one day, it found a secret that could lead to a supply chain attack on GitHub CodeQL.\n\nBut first, I needed to see if the key was usable.\n\nBackground\n\nCI/CD vulnerabilities sound complicated until you understand the terminology. Let’s catch you up.\n\nGitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows the execution of code specified within workflows as part of the CI/CD process. When you push code to a GitHub repository or create a pull request, GitHub Actions can automatically build, test, and deploy your code using workflows defined in YAML files.\n\nFor example, let’s say you are building a web application that is hosted in AWS. You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow so that whenever you push code to your repository, it is automatically tested and then deployed to AWS.\n\nIf you are new to GitHub Actions, we’d recommend reading through some examples.\n\nEvery workflow run generates a GITHUB_TOKEN — a special, automatically generated GitHub App installation token that allows the workflow to interact with the repository. This token’s permissions can be configured in the workflow file, at the repository level, or at the org level, determining what actions it can perform within the repository.\n\nPut simply:\n\nGitHub workflows execute on GitHub runners (typically a VM or Docker containers).\n\nGitHub runners need a way to authenticate to GitHub to do stuff the workflows tell them to do.\n\nFor that purpose, they use the GITHUB_TOKEN.\n\nIf the token has high privileges, then token compromise == bad.\n\nWhat are Workflow Artifacts?\n\nWe found the publicly exposed secret in a GitHub Actions workflow artifact.\n\nGitHub Actions workflows can upload workflow “artifacts” to GitHub Actions. Workflow artifacts can be any file and are saved by that workflow for later use. By default, artifacts are publicly accessible to anyone with read access to the repository and are stored for up to 90 days.\n\nAnd Finally, What is CodeQL?\n\nCodeQL is GitHub’s Code Analysis Engine. The CodeQL actions perform static code analysis on GitHub repositories to try and identify vulnerabilities. They have found several hundred CVEs over it’s lifetime, protecting organizations from breaches.\n\nSecurity tools, like CodeQL, often need access to sensitive systems and data, making them an attractive target to an attacker.\n\nIf CodeQL was compromised, one of the most widely used security tools now becomes a backdoor.\n\nFinding the Token\n\nAfter running the Actions Artifact Secrets Scanner for a day, it picked up a token in a github/codeql-action repository artifact published by this run. The Actions Artifact Secrets Scanner downloaded the “my-debug-artifacts” zip uploaded by the “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow, recursively extracted the “my-db-java-partial.zip” file stored inside, and ran Nosey Parker. Within seconds, Nosey Parker flagged a GitHub Token starting with “ghs_” in a crash report.\n\n<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.37.56-1024x443.png\" alt=\"Finding the Token\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.37.56-1024x443.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.37.56-300x130.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.37.56-768x332.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.37.56.png 1072w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nInvestigating manually, I confirmed this was a GitHub App token installation token stored in a file containing the environment variables of the GitHub Runner executing the workflow.\n\nInvestigating Impact\n\nSecrets compromise is cool, but what can we do with this token? The impact of a compromisedGITHUB_TOKEN is minimal if it only has read permissions.\n\nThe easiest way to determine the privileges of a GITHUB_TOKEN is to look at workflow logs. To investigate this, I navigated to the “Setup Job” step of the workflow that uploaded the token.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"857\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.42.13-1024x857.png\" alt=\"Investigating Impact\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.42.13-1024x857.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.42.13-300x251.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.42.13-768x643.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.42.13.png 1364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nThe GitHub token had full write privileges.\n\nWe could spend a lot of time talking about each privilege, but let’s focus on the ones that are particularly interesting.\n\nContents: write – Allows the token to create branches, create tags, and upload release artifacts.Actions: write – Allows you to work with Actions, including trigger workflow_dispatch events.Packages: write – Allows the token to upload packages.\n\nWith these privileges, an attacker has a lot of potential for repository tampering, but there is still one issue. These tokens are only valid for the duration of their specific workflow job. That means that once the job is over, the token is useless. Three things needed to happen for an attacker to be able to abuse this token:\n\nThe token needs to have some sort of write privileges (already confirmed).\n\nThe token needs to use V4 of the upload artifact API, as that is the only version that allows you to retrieve an artifact before the job is complete (and after the job is complete, the token is invalid.)\n\nThe time between uploading the artifact and completing the job needs to be great enough for us to download, extract, and use the token.\n\nIf all of these conditions are met, this publicly exposed token could be used to launch a full scale supply chain attack on CodeQL. This was like finding out that the security guard was accidentally leaving their master key in plain sight for a brief moment, over and over again.\n\nWe had to determine if the guard left us enough time to steal the key and use it before they returned to their post.\n\nLet’s investigate further. Tick, tock.\n\nDetermining the Artifact Upload Version\n\nIdentifying the artifact upload version is typically straightforward. If a workflow usesactions/upload-artifact@v4***, we can retrieve the artifact before job completion. If it uses an earlier version, we cannot do so.\n\nIn this case, CodeQL wasn’t using the actions/upload-artifact action; they were manually using the upload artifact client in the source code. Code comments indicated it used version 4. That was enough for me to continue.\n\nNow we needed to determine if the job lasted long enough for us to retrieve and use the token.\n\nCalculating our Execution Time\n\nLooking at the raw GitHub logs for this workflow, we can see two key timestamps:\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.43.08-1024x221.png\" alt=\"Calculating our Execution Time\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.43.08-1024x221.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.43.08-300x65.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.43.08-768x166.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.43.08.png 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\n“Finalizing artifact upload” occurred at 17:22:09:888.\n\nThe final step in the job, “Cleaning up orphan processes”, happened at 17:22:10:911.\n\nThat means we had approximately 1.022 seconds to download the artifact, extract the GitHub token, and use it. I noticed the token stayed valid for about a second after the “Cleaning up orphan processes” step, so we’ll call it two seconds.\n\nThe guard was giving us two seconds to steal the key and use it before they returned.Is that enough time for an attacker to use this token? Or is this another theoretical vulnerability?\n\nStart Your Engines\n\nTo test this, I made a Python script artifact_racer.py. Artifact racer performs the following actions.\n\nContinuously queries the github/codeql-action GitHub repository until it sees a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow begin.\n\nMonitors the running workflow for artifacts.\n\nOnce it sees a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow run, it downloads the artifact and extracts the GITHUB_TOKEN.\n\nShelling out for file operations and downloads was key to increasing the speed, although there are probably ways to make it even faster.\n\nUses the GITHUB_TOKEN to make a new branch.\n\nUse the GITHUB_TOKEN to push an empty file named poc.txt to that branch.\n\nMakes a new tag for that commit.\n\nIf I could make a new branch, add a file, and create a tag for that commit, that would prove an attacker could use the token for nefarious purposes before it expired.\n\nGiven that the workflow artifact was only ~21MBs, I thought we had a chance. After successfully executing against a test repository, I moved on to the github/codeql-action repository.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11-1024x429.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3815\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11-1024x429.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11-300x126.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11-768x322.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11-1536x644.png 1536w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-11.png 1728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n\nExecuting the Proof of Concept\n\nI ran the racer.\n\nAnd then I waited.\n\nAbout two hours later, a “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow executed.

Keep that in mind as we go.\n\nAfter confirming the GITHUB_TOKEN could be used within the short time window, we responsibly disclosed this vulnerability to GitHub.\n\nWhat if You’re Still Not Impressed?\n\nUsing the GITHUB_TOKEN, an attacker could add malicious code to any unprotected branch. A covert tactic would be to target feature branches pre-merge, smuggle in a small malicious code change, and wait for it to get merged. This would be especially effective due to how frequently the GitHub Actions bot commits to the CodeQL Actions repository.\n\nThey could also add tags that point to specific commits. For example, if they had malicious code on a branch and then added a v3 tag, anyone who manually used codeql-action…@v3 would execute the malicious code. More on this later.\n\nThrough code execution, you’d be able to compromise any GitHub Actions secret used within that job, as well as exfiltrate the source code of that repository. If their actions were executing on internal infrastructure, which is common with self-hosted GitHub runners, you’d also have code execution on their internal network or cloud environment.\n\nThe impact from this attack would have been very similar to the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack.\n\nThis impact is impressive, but it doesn’t quite live up to the claims I made in the beginning. Yes, through these paths, they could launch a supply chain attack against repos manually using the CodeQL actions. However, most organizations don’t include these actions manually. They just go into their repository settings, click “Enable CodeQL”, and go from there.\n\nAt first, I assumed that enabling CodeQL in your repository didn’t interact with the github/codeql-action repository at all.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nExponential Impact\n\nAfter discussing this issue with some colleagues, I decided to investigate further. What actually happens when you enable CodeQL?\n\nThis section is key to understanding the full impact of this vulnerability. Stick with me.\n\nTo investigate, I created my own public repository, “John’s Top Secret Repo”, and enabled CodeQL.\n\nAfter you enable CodeQL with the default settings, a special GitHub Actions workflow runs in your repository. This CodeQL action won’t show up in your repository workflows, but you can navigate to the workflow logs to see what it is doing.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.46.57-1024x422.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.46.57-1024x422.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.46.57-300x124.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.46.57-768x317.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.46.57.png 1174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nEnabling CodeQL in your repository settings.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"522\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.12-1024x522.png\" alt=\"CodeQL Setup\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.12-1024x522.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.12-300x153.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.12-768x391.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.12.png 1378w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nObserving the CodeQL workflow.\n\nBased on my observations, CodeQL:\n\nChecks out your repository to the filesystem\n\nInitializes CodeQL\n\nRuns CodeQL scans\n\nUploads the scan results\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"979\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.31-1024x979.png\" alt=\"CodeQL\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.31-1024x979.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.31-300x287.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.31-768x735.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.31.png 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nLet’s take a closer look at step 3.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.39-1024x230.png\" alt=\"step 3.\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.39-1024x230.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.39-300x67.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.39-768x173.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.47.39.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nIf this doesn’t shock you, look again. Remember that we have the ability to push tags to the github/codeql-action repository.\n\nCodeQL, under the hood, is executing the actions in the github/codeql-action repository, using the commit referenced by the v3 tag. This tag was not immutable, and they were not using workflow pinning (which GitHub recommends), which meant that an attacker could overwrite the v3 tag using the compromised GITHUB_TOKEN. Now, if an attacker removed and then added a v3 tag to their malicious commit, every single repository using the default CodeQL workflow would execute their malicious code.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.48.37-1024x237.png\" alt=\"CodeQL\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.48.37-1024x237.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.48.37-300x69.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.48.37-768x178.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-04-17.48.37.png 1194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nThe Action created when selecting “Advanced CodeQL” also used the reusable github/codeql-action with the v3 tag.\n\nThe CodeQL actions check out the source code of every repository they run on, which means that a malicious CodeQL action could exfiltrate the source code of any repository using default CodeQL configurations.\n\nThis would result in significant disclosure of intellectual property. And if you’ve ever operated on a Red Team, you know how many hardcoded secrets are lying around in private source code repositories.\n\nBut Wait, There’s More\n\nWe’re almost done. But remember, I promised one more thing:\n\n4. Compromise GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL\n\nWhen assessing the impact of CI/CD attack paths, I look for ways to compromise GitHub Actions secrets. Usually, those secrets are where the crown jewels live.\n\nIf the CodeQL action is executing with write privileges or alongside GitHub Actions secrets, then it’s trivial to use the code execution to exfiltrate those secrets. But the default CodeQL action uses a GITHUB_TOKEN that only has read privileges, so you can’t perform repository write operations, backdoor releases, or use fancy workflow dispatch events to steal secrets, like what happened with PyTorch.\n\nWhat the default CodeQL action does do is execute in the main branch of the repository. The main branch of any GitHub repository can write cache entries that will be used by the entire repo. This opens up an opportunity to conduct GitHub Actions cache poisoning.\n\nGitHub Actions Cache Poisoning is thoroughly explained in this article by Adnan Khan, which documents the discovery and exploitation of cache poisoning. The easiest way to conduct GitHub Actions cache poisoning is by deploying Cacheract, malware that persists in a build pipeline through cache poisoning.\n\nIf an attacker deployed Cacheract in the CodeQL workflow, it would:\n\nPredict cache entries\n\nOverwrite these entries with a malicious action\n\nGain code execution within any workflow that uses action-cache (the Actions Cache is used by most repositories)\n\nLeverage code execution to compromise GitHub Actions secrets used by those workflows, capture privileged GITHUB_TOKENs, and more\n\nEven if someone noticed the malicious CodeQL action and remediated the vulnerability, Cacheract would continue poisoning caches.\n\nI spent ten minutes looking for prominent repos that use CodeQL & actions/cache and identifiedHomebrew, Angular, and Grafana.\n\nCache poisoning would allow an attacker to leverage this CodeQL supply chain attack to gain write access to repositories and repository secrets.\n\nCongratulations, You Made It\n\nWe’ve now hit all the impact highlights I mentioned at the beginning:\n\nCompromise intellectual property by exfiltrating the source code of all private repositories using CodeQL.\n\nSteal credentials within GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow job using CodeQL, and leverage those secrets to execute further supply chain attacks.\n\nExecute code on internal infrastructure running CodeQL workflows.\n\nCompromise GitHub Actions secrets of any workflow using the GitHub Actions Cache within a repo that uses CodeQL.\n\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-1024x351.png\" alt=\"Congratulations, You Made It\" srcset=\"https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-1024x351.png 1024w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-300x103.png 300w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-768x263.png 768w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-1536x526.png 1536w, https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Box-Notes-Image-2025-02-15-11.23.53-2048x701.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/>\n\nSupply chain attacks like these are scary, especially when they start with something as simple as a publicly exposed credential. If this is your first time hearing about abusing GitHub Actions to launch supply chain attacks, I’ll let you in on a secret: these vulnerabilities occur all the time.\n\nGitHub Actions abuse has been around for several years, but it is still one of the highest-impact, least-understood vulnerability classes. That is slowly starting to change (emphasis on ~slowly~). The DevOps and security communities need to commit to learning about these vulnerabilities to protect their organizations from risk. Vulnerabilities like this, and the recent tj-actions/changed-files supply chain attack, are starting to bring these issues to the public spotlight. That is why we invest in research to uncover these vulnerabilities and design solutions to prevent them.\n\nCVE-2025-24362\n\nA side-effect of this disclosure was CVE-2025-24362. The publicly exposed GITHUB_TOKEN was within a debug artifact uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow. The CodeQL Actions repository was intentionally triggering this failure, but other users of CodeQL Actions could have exposed their own secrets as environment variables to the workflow, had their workflows experienced a similar failure.\n\nThis issue was fixed in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3.\n\nEven though this disclosure resulted in a CVE, the highest potential impact still lies in exploiting that vulnerability against the CodeQL Actions repository and launching a supply chain attack against CodeQL users.\n\nRemediation\n\nGitHub had one of the most rapid and impressive remediation responses we have ever seen.\n\nJan 22, 2025, 3:13 PM UTC: Report Submitted to GitHubJan 22, 2025, 5:48 PM UTC: GitHub acknowledged receipt of the submissionJan 22, 2025, 6:28 PM UTC: GitHub confirmed the vulnerability, temporarily disabled the “PR Check – Debug artifacts after failure” workflow, and submitted this PR to disable debug artifacts upload. This occurred just three hours after submitting the report, which is a very rapid resolution time.Jan 24, 2025: GitHub assigned CVE-2025-24362 and published this security advisory, which notes they found no evidence of compromise to its platform or systems.\n\nIf you are concerned about you’re own GitHub Actions workflow artifacts, you can take the following steps to limit the risk of secrets exposure:\n\nideally, only upload specific files or directories as workflow artifacts\n\navoid uploading artifacts containing environment variables, the .git/config file, or any files in the runner’s <path_to_runner_dir>/_work/_temp/ directory\n\nlimit GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to read-only\n\nscan artifacts for secrets prior to uploading\n\nTo learn more about this vulnerability, how I discovered it, and how you can detect similar vulnerabilities in your own environment, please join me for a webinar on April 10 at 1pm ET.\n\nHow Can Praetorian Help\n\nPraetorian has been leading the charge in offensive CI/CD security for several years, inventing novel tooling and giving presentations at Black Hat, DEF CON, Schmoocon, and Black Hat Arsenal.\n\nOur Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) platform, Chariot, can identify vulnerabilities like this in your attack surface before the attackers do.\n\nOur CI/CD Security Assessments can take an in-depth look at your internal CI/CD security posture, enumerating attack paths that an attacker would exploit to go from low-privileged access to complete organization compromise.\n\nThe next major supply chain attack could start with something as simple as a publicly exposed secret.

Photograph: Vernon RichardsGeorge OrwellInterviewGeorge Orwell and me: Richard Blair on life with his extraordinary fatherSimon HattenstoneThe literary giant’s only child reflects on his father’s devotion in their days together in rural Scotland, his early death, his genius as a writer – and his reputation as a womaniserWed 19 Mar 2025 05.00 GMTLast modified on Wed 19 Mar 2025 09.54 GMTShareRichard Blair didn’t have the easiest start in life. At three weeks old, he was adopted. Nine months later, his adoptive mother, Eileen, died at 39, after an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic she was given for a hysterectomy. Family and friends expected Blair’s father, Eric, to un-adopt him. Fortunately, Eric, better known as George Orwell, was an unusually hands-on dad for the 1940s.Orwell and Eileen had wanted children for years, but he was sterile and it is likely that she was infertile as a result of uterine cancer. Having finally agreed to adopt after their struggle, Orwell was not going to give up on his son. “The thing he wanted most in life was to have children,” says Blair. “And now I was his family.”We are in the kitchen of Blair’s home and he is making me a cuppa. On the kitchen wall is a framed poster of his father’s famous instructions for making tea. “Usetea from India or Ceylon (SriLanka), not China,” it starts. “Use ateapot, preferably ceramic. Warm the pot over direct heat. Tea should be strong, six spoons of leaves per litre. Let the leaves move around the pot. No bags or strainers. Take the pot to the boiling kettle. Stir or shake the pot. Drink out of a tall, mug-shaped teacup. Don’t add creamy milk. Addmilk to the tea, not vice versa. No sugar!”Orwell, perhaps the most influential writer of the 20th century, railed against totalitarianism in his dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four; chronicled it in his memoir about fighting in the Spanish civil war, Homage to Catalonia; and satirised it in his wonderful fable Animal Farm. Yet it has to be said his tea-making rules verge on the autocratic. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised. Orwell, who died at 46 in 1950, was a cauldron of contradictions – asingle‑minded rebel so concerned about embarrassing his parents when writing about homelessness that he adopted a pen name; an Old Etonian man of the people; an introverted party animal; an egalitarian socialist and bigot; a man who railed against the “incorrigible dirtiness and untidiness” and the “terrible, devouring sexuality” of women, but who lived in filth and devoured as many women as possible.View image in fullscreenRichard Blair with a maquette of George Orwell Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianBlair apologises. No teapot, no leaves; he is making do with a teabag. “It is from Harrods, though!” He is 80 years old, just like Animal Farm. Blair hands me the tea in an orange-and-white mug designed like an old-fashioned Penguin book cover of Nineteen Eighty-Four. “Biscuits?” He gets out the chocolate digestives. On the table is a copy of today’s DailyTelegraph.You couldn’t imagine two more different men. Orwell was a puritan radical; Blair is a “leftwing Conservative” who says he could never vote for Labour because he can’t bear the thought of singing The Red Flag. Orwell detested the privilege into which he was born and spent much of his life living in squalor; Blair lives a cosy, suburban life in a pretty, middle-class village near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire. Orwell was a police officer in Burma, now Myanmar; ran around with revolutionaries in Spain, where he got shot in the throat; lived on the streets in London; hung out in brothels in Paris; and retreated to the remote island of Jura towards the end of his life to write Nineteen Eighty-Four. Blair, meanwhile, started out as a farmer before training people to sell tractors, finally ending up as a landlord for holiday cottages in Craignish on thewest coast of Scotland.Yet Orwell has shaped his life. “My father was devoted to me,” hesays. “Absolutely devoted.” AndBlair is equally devoted to him.He regards himself as the keeper of thesacred flame for his father.Blair, a broad man with caterpillar eyebrows and an establishment air, looks out over his large garden and says if he had been sensible he would have bought the plot of land next to their house; it would be worth a fortune now. On a shelf in the hallway, we pass a maquette of the Orwell sculpture that stands outside Broadcasting House in London. Heis instantly recognisable – thin as a pipe cleaner, gangly (he was 6ft2in, or 1.88 metres, tall), pencil moustache, waves of dark hair, fag in hand.View image in fullscreen‘My father was devoted to me’ … Blair with Orwell. Photograph: Vernon RichardsOpposite is a mounted plaque featuring a slab of slate and an illustration of a white stone house. Underneath, it says: “This fragment of slate came from the roof of Barnhill, Isle of Jura, which Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell) rented from May 1946 until his death in January 1950. It was here that he wrote his final great novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.” This handsome memento is signed “Richard Blair, Patron of The Orwell Society”. He tells me he got the slate when the roof had to be replaced and sells theplaques for £60 a pop.After Eileen’s death, with his health declining as a result of the tuberculosis that would kill him, Orwell looked for somewhere suitably remote where he could focus on writing and Blair could enjoy the freedom of nature. His friend David Astor – the editor of the Observer, for which Orwell wrote, from 1948 to 1975 – had a home on Jura and suggested it would be perfect for their needs. When Blair was two, father and son headed to the island, accompanied by a nanny and Orwell’s younger sister, Avril. It was here that Blair got to know his father.Young Blair and Orwell were a solid team. Orwell continued to do things on his own terms, as he always had. Work took priority; he went on trips when he fancied or was commissioned; and he continued chasing women, asking at least four to marry him after Eileen’s death, until Sonia Brownell finally agreed to become his second wife on his deathbed.But as far as Blair is concerned, Jura provided a father-son paradise. “I loved it. Here I was in a farmhouse, well shod, had clothes, plenty to eat, and I could roam anywhere I liked, which you couldn’t do in London. Just a fabulous place to live.” There were no other children, but it didn’t bother him. While his father wrote, Blair explored. They would meet for breakfast and high tea, cooked by Aunt Avril. On summer evenings, he and his father would go out fishing for crab and lobster.They had so many adventures together, most involving an element of danger. Blair tells me of the time his father was making a wooden toy for him in his shed while he watched from on high, standing on a chair. Blair fell, crashed into a china jug and cracked his head open. Then there was the occasion when Blair, now a mature three-year-old, found a pipe, stuffed it with tobacco and over lunch asked his father for a light. “The lighter was passed surreptitiously, without breaking the conversation, behind his back. I tried to light this pipe and got something going. Of course, you can imagine what happened next. Sick as a cat.”View image in fullscreen‘My father’s outpourings were phenomenal’ … a commemorative plaque in Blair’s Warwickshire home. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianMost memorable was the time Orwell misread the tide when they were out in the hazardous Gulf of Corryvreckan, home to one of the world’s biggest whirlpools. Their dinghy overturned and they almost drowned. Did that shock Orwell? “Ithink it gave him a hell of a shock, yes, absolutely.” Was his father as reckless with you as with himself? Blair smiles. “Well, health and safety didn’t really rear its ugly head in those days, did it? And yet we survived.”There was one precaution Orwell did take. “He said I had to have a pair of decent, stout boots, because of the snakes. Jura has got a lot of adders. They’re not desperately poisonous, but he had a thing about snakes, probably because of his days in Burma.” Was he scared of them? “Yes, to a degree, but not scared enough that he wouldn’t stamp on them and kill them.” Orwell treated his son as a mini-adult, perhaps not surprisingly, ashe had little experience of children and there were no other kids around.But there were plenty of visitors– too many, according to Avril, who worried that they distracted Orwell from his work and was aware that his time was limited. Blair says his aunt, who became his legal guardian after Orwell died, has been treated unfairly by biographers. “Avril has been described as a sourpuss. That’s absolute crap,” he explodes. “She was very protective of my father and was trying to stop a lot of stupid people wasting his time, coming to Jura and drinking his drink and just generally buggering around and stopping him from getting on with what he wanted todo.”He was frightened that I wouldn’t bond with him because he couldn’t give hugs or kiss me because he might pass on his TBWho were these wasters? He mentions the poet Paul Potts. “God,he was a ghastly man.” Why? “He was just a disgusting old man. He could probably survive on the food that he got in his tie for about a week.” Did Orwell think he was disgusting? “They seemed to get on well. I think my father tolerated him. Paul Potts loved him and thought he was wonderful.”But Orwell spent so much of the time in his bedroom, writing, sleeping and being ill. Was Blair aware how ill his father was? He shakes his head. “No, I was asking: ‘Where does it hurt, Dada?’ thinking it hurt like when I cracked my head open.” Towards the end, Orwell was hollowed out by his tuberculosis. Blair found out years later that his father was terrified of passing his TB on to him – and even more scared that they would become distant because he couldn’t show physical affection. “It’s all written down in the letters. He was frightened that I wouldn’t bond with him because he couldn’t give hugs or kiss me because he might pass on the bacillus to me.”In January 1949, his father was admitted to the Cotswold sanatorium in Cranham, Gloucestershire. Blair’s final memory is visiting him with Avril a year later, by which time he had been moved to University College hospital in London. “A week later, an announcement came over the BBC’s Home Service, as it was in those days, saying the death has occurred today of George Orwell, author of Nineteen Eighty-Four.”Did he know this was his father? “Yes, because there was so much consternation in the house.” That is incredible, I say, hearing about the death of your dad on the radio. He nods. “Yes. Did I cry? I probably did. At that age, you take these things in your stride, don’t you?” Blair was five years old.He went to live on a farm near Jura with Avril and her husband, Bill. Uncle Bill, who had lost his leg in the war, taught him everything he knew about farming. Over time, Blair learned more about his parents. Did Orwell ever talk about Eileen? “No. I knew nothing about my mother until I read about her. We’re not a highly communicative family. I didn’t know I was adopted until I was about nine or 10. Avril was driving me somewhere and just dropped it in the conversation.” How did it make him feel? He laughs. “The impact was like a pebble in a pond. From a very early age, I was pushed around from pillar to post. When my mother died, my father had to find somebody to look after me while he was going away. So I would stay with all sorts of people.”He had always known that Orwell was a writer. At 12, he read his work – first Animal Farm, then Nineteen Eighty-Four. “Those were the only two books that people read of his back then.” What did he think? “Well, I enjoyed Animal Farm. It was a jolly good book.” Which did he prefer? “Nineteen Eighty-Four was much more difficult to understand, to get the full meaning of it.” He admits he didn’t understand at the time that Animal Farm was an allegory aboutStalinism.View image in fullscreen‘I could roam anywhere I liked’ … Barnhill, the house on Jura where Orwell wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianDoes he find it strange that words and expressions such as doublespeak, Big Brother and Orwellian have become common parlance? “Oh God, you can’t pick up a newspaper without finding a reference to this or that being Orwellian. And, of course, you stopand think: hang on, they’re talking about my father here.”Blair went from the farm to farming college. He married Eleanor at 20 and they are still together. For many years, he did not benefit from Orwell’s royalties and lived modestly. Towards the end of his father’s life, Orwell’s accountant had set up George Orwell Productions, from which the author was paid a salary. After his death, the money held in the estate gradually disappeared. “Let’s call it bad investments by the accountant,” Blair says elliptically. Sonia battled for decades to regain control of George Orwell Productions. Days after she won her court case, she died. It took about nine years for the estate to besorted. Blair was the sole legatee. He says the money started rolling in as the year 1984 approached, as publishers, TV companies and film‑makers cashedin on Orwell’snovel.Have the royalties made much difference to Blair’s life? “Yes,” he says. He was able to buy the house we are in today. How long have he and his family been here? “Since 1984!” He smiles. “But that’s justhappenstance.”There could have been a dramatic change in lifestyle, he says, but he has erred on the side of caution. “I’ve supported the Orwell Foundation to some extent and the Orwell Society a little bit. Hopefully, there will be money for my children and grandchildren to inherit. My accountant said: ‘Richard, do you want to become a tax exile? Do you want to go to Spain?’ Which is what one did in the old days. Eleanor said she didn’twant to go to bloody Spain and become a gin-and-tonic refugee. So we stayed put and we’ve had to put up with all the taxes. Another biscuit?”Since retiring, he has dedicated himself to his father’s memory. He goes abroad to give talks on Orwell and leads tours around Catalonia, showing people where his father fought in the Spanish civil war. Over time, he has become more of an expert on his father. Often, he says, he is not sure whether his knowledge is based on first-hand experience, what people have told him, what he has read or a mix of all three.Orwell’s family had been well‑off, thanks to the slave trade. His great-great-grandfather, Charles Blair, was a wealthy Scot who owned plantations in Jamaica. After slavery was abolished in many of Britain’s colonies in 1833, the Blairs were one of 3,000 slave-owning families paid a total of £20m in compensation, the equivalent by one calculation of about £17bn today. But by the time Orwell was born in Motihari, in what is now the state of Bihar in north-east India, most of the family money had gone. His father, also Richard Blair, worked in the opium department of the Indian civil service. When Orwell was one, his mother, Ida, moved back to England, while his father continued working in India. He spent his childhood with Ida and his sisters in Oxfordshire.His family would not have been able to educate Orwell privately if he had not won scholarships, first to St Cyprian’s prep school in Eastbourne, East Sussex, and then Eton. In a posthumously published essay, Such, Such Were the Joys, about his days at St Cyprian’s, he said he hated the place and was frequently made aware that he was “from a poorer home”. After Eton, he would have needed another scholarship to go on to university. His parents assumed he would not win one because of his poor exam results, so he enrolled in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, which partly inspired his first novel, Burmese Days.There are many biographies of Orwell, several of them controversial in one way or another. Some appear to sanctify him, others to demonise him. Through reading about his father, Blair has also learned about his mother. Eileen’s family were successful and well-to-do – her father was the customs and excise chief in Tyneside. As for Eileen, she graduated in English from the University of Oxford. A poet and psychologist, she worked in the censorship department of the Ministry of Information at the beginning of the second world war, then moved to the Ministry of Food and co-wrote scripts for a daily BBC programme called The Kitchen Front.View image in fullscreen‘She was quite the equal to my father in terms of intellectual capacity’ … Blair with his mother, Eileen, who died in 1945. Photograph: Sonia Brownell Orwell/UCL Special Collections“She was well educated, quite the equal to my father in terms of intellectual capacity,” Blair says proudly. And then, another explosion. “There’s so much fucking rubbish being churned out, especially from one particular direction. That’s absolute garbage.” I ask what he means. He tells me he is referring to Anna Funder’s book Wifedom, which suggests Eileen was subservient to Orwell and effectively written out of history. He believes Funder took liberties by combining fact with the imagined musings of Eileen and her own thoughts on modern patriarchy.The problem, he says, is everything has been taken out of context. “I think my mother had decided that my father was the real breadwinner and she would acquiesce, as you did in those days. The mores of the time were that the wife usually fell in with the husband.” Yet he seems to agree with much of what Funder says about his mother being overlooked, and praises Sylvia Topp’s book Eileen: The Making of George Orwell. “I don’t think Eileen did have enough credit. She was sidelined to some extent. What Sylvia has done is taken Eileen and put her at the front of Orwell and put her in proper context.”Take Animal Farm, he says – Eileen made a huge contribution to it. Some say she came up with the idea. “You can tell that there’s alot of my mother’s input in Animal Farm, because it’s a completely different book. It’s got a light touch to it. She helped him in structuring the book, I think, and putting the animals in the right context.” Orwell is thought to have got the title for Nineteen Eighty-Four from a poem Eileen wrote called End of the Century, 1984. “She was highly intelligent and had an extraordinary sense of humour, which a lot of people haven’t quite cottoned on to. Very, very funny– you know, the wonderful letter thatshe wrote to Nora Miles, her friend, in which she said the next letter you get will be a round robin telling everyone I’ve killed myhusband.”That was soon after they got married and were living in a grubby home in Wallington, Hertfordshire. “It was quite a nice little house. It had running water – down all four bloody walls!” He enjoys the joke. “It was pretty rough. And this was for a young lady who was well brought up.” His mother wasn’t used to slumming it. Eileen made no attempt to hide that Orwell could be insufferable – needy, spoilt, impetuous, self-obsessed. But he was also formidably talented, visionary and prolific.As well as the six novels, there were the three nonfiction books, numerous essays, journals, pamphlets, newspaper articles and poems. Of his father’s writings, what does Blair go to first? “His essays,” he says instantly. “The essays are brilliant. They really are. They’re full of humour.” He cites any number of them: How the Poor Die; A Hanging; Shooting an Elephant; Such, Such Were the Joys. “You can also extract lumps out of books that are stand-alone essays in their own right. In The Road to Wigan Pier, you can take two parts. There’s the description of the tripe shop – after you’ve read that, you’d never eat tripe again. And the other one is the very short essay of the girl poking a stick up a foul drain, which – whether or not it happened, or not in the circumstances in which he wrote it– is a brilliant piece of reportage.”I would like to think his attitude towards women would have changed, because it’s a bit starkDoes anything make him feel uncomfortable about his father’s work? “Yes. He was very black and white about categorising people. The sandal-wearing, bearded liberal-lefties with sweaters, he didn’t like them at all. And shopkeepers were usually rightwing types.” Does he think Orwell was a snob? “I don’t know. The problem was he spoke with an Old Etonian accent, so that didn’t help, did it? When he went to Spain and was introduced to John McNair, the Tynesider, who was with the Independent Labour party, McNair said: ‘Christ, who’s this bloody tosser?’ Then he found out he’d written Down and Out in Paris and London and Burmese Days andrealised who he was. And he goes: ‘Oh, OK!’”I tell him I was shocked by Orwell’s comments about Jews in Down and Out. “Yessss,” Blair says circumspectly. “Was he antisemitic? From Down and Out in Paris and London, you might say that he was, but I think he was commenting about what other people think of Jews. ‘This is not what I think about a Jew, it is what other people think about Jews and I’m just recording it.’”To an extent. But certainly not all the time. In Down and Out, he writes: “The shopman was a red-haired Jew, an extraordinarily disagreeable man … it would have been a pleasure to flatten the Jew’s nose if only one could have afforded it.” Jews are so often mean, corrupt, ugly and nasty in Orwell’s work. Later in life, he rowed back on his antisemitism. He despised nazism and declared: “Antisemitism … is simply not the doctrine of a grown-up person,” even if he continued to stereotype Jews in his writing.The reality is that Orwell was a product of his time, Blair says. He suggests his father was an equal-opportunities offender. “I’m not absolutely certain that he disliked Jews any more than he disliked anybody else. He was a bit anti-Scots for a while. But, towards the end, he was actually quite pro‑Scots. Had he lived for another 20 years, I think there is no question that he would have revised his thoughts on a lot of what he had written, because he was open to criticism and if he was wrong he would say so. You only have to go to his little list, his black book of fellow travellers, that he was asked to do by Celia Kirwan. Helater said: ‘You know, some of the people that I criticised I may have been wrong about.’”View image in fullscreen‘It doesn’t worry me that I have not achieved what he achieved’ … Blair at home. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianThe notebook, in which Orwell named 135 suspected communist sympathisers, was handed to his friend Kirwan in 1949, while she was working at the Foreign Office’s semi-secret Information Research Department. It came to light in 2003 and led to Orwell being condemned online as a “reactionary snitch”, a “McCarthyite Weasel” and a “fake socialist”. Does Blair think his father would have regretted compiling the list if he had lived longer? “No, I don’t think so.” After all, says Blair, Orwell thought Stalinism was as great a totalitarian menace as nazism.But he does think, or at least hope, that his father’s attitude to women would have evolved over time. There are so many examples in Orwell’s correspondence of him making, at best, clumsy or inappropriate passes at women. On occasion, he simply seems to pounce on them. He comes across as predatory, I say to Blair. He nods. “He does, yes. I would like to think his attitude towards women would have changed, because it’s a bit stark.” Some people say he was misogynistic, I add. “Ithink perhaps he was. He did have a roving eye. He pushed the envelope.” Blair puts a positive spin on it. “He had an open mind and he was able to think beyond the norms of everyday living and behaviour.”Some women had to push him off, I say. “Well, they did, yes. They had to keep him at bay. The thing is that he liked the company of women who had got a brain, who actually could give him a good argument and could think. He wasn’t going to seduce some bimbo.” He flushes apologetically. “Sorry, I know you’re not allowed tosay that, are you?”Does he think his father’s behaviour would have been tolerated today? “Probably not. ‘Why do you do it, you bloody fool? You’re going to get caught,’” he says, as if addressing his father directly. Is he referring to the affairs and the inappropriate behaviour? “Yeah, I mean, the old adage, thou shalt not be found out.” Or, even better, thou shalt not do it in the first place. “Absolutely. I think I’ve led a reasonably blameless life.”Nothing but the truth: the legacy of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-FourRead moreEileen threatened to leave Orwell because of his womanising. Blair mentions an occasion, when his parents were living in Marrakech, when Orwell asked Eileen to let himsleep with a young Berber woman as a birthday present. “Shesaid: ‘Yeah, for Christ’s sake, get on with it!’”If you said to Eleanor you would like to sleep with a young woman as a birthday present, how would it go down? “Well, we’ve been married for 60 years. No, no, I wouldn’t. Christ, I’ve had enough problems with the one I’ve got.” He stops. “Ihave my tongue firmly in my cheek here.”The thing is, says Blair, Orwell was complex – and so were his relationships. Many women liked him, for starters. In some ways, Blair believes his father was a romantic. “When he met Eileen for the first time, he said to a friend: ‘That is the woman that I would liketo marry.’”Whatever his shortcomings as a man, Orwell was a literary giant who dedicated his life to exploring the weightiest of subjects – tyranny, war and poverty. Perhaps the most remarkable thing, considering his prodigious output, is that he did so much and wrote so much in so short a life. Does it make Blair reflect on his life? “It doesn’t worry me that I have not achieved what he achieved. I’ve tried to lead a reasonably Christian life and I’m fairly satisfied with what I’ve achieved so far. I was never going to be prime minister, thank God. My father’s outpourings werephenomenal. The wordage that he put out was huge. He used to say that a day not writing was aday lost.”He brings over the maquette for the photographer. It’s extraordinarily heavy, but Blair carries it with such ease that it could be made of foam. I ask if he sees any similarities between him and his father. “No, I don’t think so. He was a highly intelligent academic. I’m quite the reverse. Iwas very good at the work I did, but a lot of it was manual. I was a senior demonstrator and ended up in sales training for the tractor people Massey Ferguson. That’s hardly an intellectual occupation.”Did he ever fancy writing? “No, no, I’m too bloody lazy.” Is it laziness or that his father was a hard act to follow? “Well, I’ve often said that it’s just as well I wasn’t actually DNA-related to him, because everyone would say: ‘Look at your father and look at therubbish you’re churning out.’ You would always be compared with your father.”It’s enough for Blair to try to ensure that the Orwell torch continues to burn bright. Not that his father needs much help. I ask what is more important for him, hislegacy or his father’s? “My father’s legacy,” he says instantly. “I’m just a keeper – the ordinary son of an extraordinary father.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge OrwellLiterary criticismfeaturesShareReuse this content",

      "en": "Richard Blair, the only son of George Orwell, reflects on his father's life and their time together, sharing insights about Orwell’s character and their relationship. \n\nRichard was adopted shortly after birth, and following the death of his adoptive mother, Orwell, known for his hands-on parenting style, took care of him in rural Scotland. Despite Orwell’s literary brilliance and his struggles with personal issues, Richard remembers him as a devoted father. They shared simple joys, like fishing and exploring nature, while Orwell focused on his writing.\n\nOrwell, a complex figure, battled tuberculosis and had a tumultuous personal life, including multiple romantic relationships. Richard acknowledges the contradictions in Orwell’s character, including his views on women, which may have evolved if he had lived longer. Richard also addresses the controversies surrounding Orwell's views on various subjects, including his earlier attitudes towards Jews.\n\nAfter Orwell's death when Richard was just five, he grew up learning about his father's legacy and the impact of his works, like \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and \"Animal Farm.\" Richard has dedicated himself to preserving Orwell’s memory and has become knowledgeable about his father's life and writings.\n\nOverall, Richard sees himself as a caretaker of Orwell’s legacy, proud of his father’s profound influence on literature and society, even as he acknowledges that he has chosen a different path in life.",

Japanese history in January 1700. Samurai, merchants, and villagers wrote of minor flooding and damage. Some noted that no parent earthquake had been felt; they were wondering what had set off the waves. They had no way knowing that the tsunami had been spawned during an earthquake along the coast of northwestern North America. This orphan tsunami would not be linked to its parent earthquake until the middle 1990s, through an extraordinary series of discoveries in both North America and Japan.\nThe Orphan Tsunami of 1700, now in its second edition, tells this scientific detective story through its North American and Japanese clues. The discoveries underpin many of today’s precautions against earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of northwestern North America. The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 called attention to those hazards as a mirror image of the transpacific waves of January 1700.\n\n                    Suggested Citation\n                    Atwater, B.F., Musumi-Rokkaku, S., Satake, K., Tsuji, Y., Ueda, K., and Yamaguchi, D.K., 2015, The orphan tsunami of 1700—Japanese clues to a parent earthquake in North America, 2nd ed.: Seattle, University of Washington Press, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1707, 135 p.\n\n                        ISSN: 2330-7102 (online)\n\n                        ISSN: 1044-9612 (print)\n\n                        Table of Contents\n                        Preface to the second editionIntroductionPart 1 Unearthed earthquakesPart 2The orphan tsunamiKuwagasakiTsugaruishiTsuchiNakaminatoMihoTanabePart 3The orphan’s parentAcknowledgmentsAuthorsReferencesIndexAfterword, 2015\n\n                            Publication type\n                            Report\n\n                            Publication Subtype\n                            USGS Numbered Series\n\n                            Title\n                            The orphan tsunami of 1700—Japanese clues to a parent earthquake in North America\n\n                            Series title\n                            Professional Paper\n\n                            Series number\n                            1707\n\n                            DOI\n                            10.3133/pp1707\n\n                            Edition\n                            First Edition: Originally posted 2005; Second Edition: 2015\n\n                            Year Published\n                            2005\n\n                            Language\n                            English, Japanese\n\n                            Description\n                            vii, 135 p.\n\n                            Country\n                            Japan, United States\n\n                            Online Only (Y/N)\n                            N\n\n                            Additional Online Files (Y/N)\n                            N\n\n                    Additional publication details\n\n                    Part or all of this report is presented in Portable Document Format\n                        (PDF).

    "content": "Finalizers are tricker than you might think. Part 2\n\n      Mar 27, 2025\n\n    In the previous part we discussed why the finalizers should only deal with unmanaged resources and in this post I want to show that this is not as simple as it sounds.\n\nLet’s reiterate again what a native resource is. Native resource is a resource that is not managed by the CLR. Such resource is typically handled by native code and is exposed via the following API:\n\n  a “constructor” that allocates the resource and returns a handle to it\n  a “destructor” that cleans the resource up and\n  a set of methods that take a handle to perform an operation\n\nFor example, RocksDb is a well-known key-value store written in C++ with C-bindings that allow non-C++ application to consume it via an interoperable API. Here is a naive example of such API.\n\npublic static class RocksDbNative\n{\n    private static readonly HashSet<IntPtr> ValidHandles = new();\n    public static IntPtr CreateDb()\n    {\n        // Allocating native resource used by the DB.\n        IntPtr handle = 42;\n        Trace(\"Creating Db\", handle);\n        ValidHandles.Add(handle);\n        return handle;\n    }\n\n    public static void DestroyDb(IntPtr handle)\n    {\n        Trace(\"Destroying Db\", handle);\n        ValidHandles.Remove(handle);\n        // Cleaning up the resources associated with the handle.\n    }\n\n    public static void UseDb(IntPtr handle)\n    {\n        Trace(\"Starting using Db\", handle);\n        // Just mimic some extra work a method might do.\n        PerformLongRunningPrerequisite();\n\n        // Using the handle\n        Trace(\"Using Db\", handle);\n        PInvokeIntoDb(handle);\n    }\n\n    private static void PInvokeIntoDb(IntPtr handle) {}\n\n    private static void Trace(string message, IntPtr handle)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\n            $\"{message}. Id: {handle}, IsValid: {IsValid(handle)}.\");\n    }\n\n    public static bool IsValid(IntPtr handle) => ValidHandles.Contains(handle);\n\n    private static void PerformLongRunningPrerequisite()\n    {\n        // Skipped for now.\n    }\n}\n\nWe don’t want to use native resource directly, so we’ll create a wrapper - RocksDbWrapper:\n\npublic class RocksDbWrapper : IDisposable\n{\n    private IntPtr _handle = RocksDbNative.CreateDb();\n\n    public void Dispose() => Dispose(true);\n\n    public void UseRocksDb() => RocksDbNative.UseDb(_handle);\n\n    private void Dispose(bool disposing) => RocksDbNative.DestroyDb(_handle);\n\n    ~RocksDbWrapper() => Dispose(false);\n}\n\nThe class implements IDisposable interface for eager and timely resource clean-up and since it has unmanaged resources it also has the finalizer.\n\nAnd here is the usage:\nstatic void UseRocksDbWrapper()\n{\n    new RocksDbWrapper().UseRocksDb();\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Done using RocksDb!\");\n    GC.Collect();\n    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\n    GC.Collect();\n}\n\nThe RocksDbWrapper is disposable but the code doesn’t call Dispose and just creates the instance and calls UseRocksDb. This is not great, but since the class has a finalizer we should be fine. Right? Right!\n\nLet’s see the output:\n\nCreating Db. Id: 42, IsValid: False.\nStarting using Db. Id: 42, IsValid: True.\nDestroying Db. Id: 42, IsValid: True.\nUsing Db. Id: 42, **IsValid: False.**\n\nThe native handle was closed before it was used in RocksDbNative.UseDb, probably causing a crash in real world. But WHY??\n\nNOTE: To reproduce all the following examples you need to run the code in Release mode and disable tiered compilation for NET5+. Tier0 compilation does not track the lifetime of local variables so you either need to run a method multiple time to propagate it to further tiers or just disable tiered compilation altogether.\n\nFirst of all, lets check what the body of PerformLongRunningPrerequisite does.\n\nprivate static void PerformLongRunningPrerequisite()\n{\n    Thread.Sleep(100);\n    // Code runs long enough to cause the GC to run twice.\n    GC.Collect();\n    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\n    GC.Collect();\n}\n\nIt forces the two GC cycles, to consistently reproduce this issue. In reality you won’t run the GC twice, so the issue won’t be as easily reproduceable, instead you’ll be getting crashes once in a blue moon, making such investigation very painful.\n\nLet’s figure out step by step, why the native resource was cleaned up before it was used. And to get to the bottom of this we need to understand some things about the GC.\nCan a local variable be collected during a method call?\nYes, it can. Here is an example:\n\npublic static void ShowReachability()\n{\n    object o1 = new object();\n    object o2 = new object();\n    var wr1 = new WeakReference(o1);\n    var wr2 = new WeakReference(o2);\n    GC.Collect();\n    Console.WriteLine($\"o1 alive: { wr1.IsAlive}, o2 alive: { wr2.IsAlive}\");\n    GC.KeepAlive(o2);\n}\n\no1 alive: false, o2 alive: true\n\nIf a local variable is a final root reference, the instance becomes eligible by the GC right after its final usage, and not at the end of the method. This is possible, because the GC tracks when the variable is no longer used, and stores this information in internal data structure called GCInfo. And such tracking is only done in release mode and only for a fully optimized code. That’s why the behavior is different in debug mode or when the code is compiled by Tier0 JIT.\n\nFor more info, see my post Garbage collection and variable lifetime tracking.\nCan an instance be collected during an instance method call?\nAnd the answer is again, Yes, it can! Here is a more complicated example:\npublic class InstanceEligibility\n{\n    public void Test()\n    {\n        var wr = new WeakReference(this);\n        GC.Collect();\n        if (!wr.IsAlive)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The instance was collected by the GC!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf you run new InstanceEligibility().Test(), you’ll see that wr.IsAlive will be false and the message will be printed to the console.\n\nFrom the CLR’s perspective the instance method is just a static method where the instance is passed implicitly via the first parameter. And similarly to the previous case, the instance becomes eligible by the GC after its final usage in the method.\nGetting everything together\n\nLet’s get back to our example and show exactly what is going on at runtime when the following call is made: new RocksDbWrapper().UseRocksDb():\n\nIf you’re asking yourself, is it possible to have this in real world, the answer is: For sure!\n\nSo, what’s the solution?\nUsing Safe Handle\nWhat’s the proper way of dealing with native resources? Wrap them into safe handles. SafeHandle is a special base type from BCL that is designed for managing native resources. Here is an example for our case:\npublic class RocksDbSafeHandle : SafeHandle\n{\n    private int _released = 0;\n\n    /// <inheritdoc />\n    private RocksDbSafeHandle(IntPtr handle) : base(handle, ownsHandle: true) { }\n\n    public static RocksDbSafeHandle Create()\n\t    => new RocksDbSafeHandle(RocksDbNative.CreateDb());\n\n    /// <inheritdoc />\n    protected override bool ReleaseHandle()\n    {\n        if (Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref _released, 1, 0) == 0)\n        {\n            RocksDbNative.DestroyDb(handle);\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    /// <inheritdoc />\n    public override bool IsInvalid => _released != 0;\n\n    /// <inheritdoc />\n    public override string ToString() => handle.ToString();\n\n    internal IntPtr Handle => this.handle;\n}\n\nNotice, that we don’t have the finalizer here. Instead, we just derive from SafeHandle and override two methods: ReleaseHandle and IsValid. That’s it!\n\nAnd instead of using IntPtr we’re going to use RocksDbSafeHandle, including the RocksDbNative class:\n\npublic static class RocksDbNative\n{\n\tpublic static void UseDb(RocksDbSafeHandle handle)\n\t{\n\t    Trace(\"Starting using Db\", handle);\n\t    PerformLongRunningPrerequisite();\n\n\t    // Using the handle\n\t    Trace(\"Using Db\", handle);\n\t    PInvokeIntoDb(handle.Handle);\n\t    // Making sure the ‘handle’ is not collected during PInvoke\n\t    GC.KeepAlive(handle);\n\t}\n}\n\nNow, this is safe, since the handle instance itself is not eligible by the GC until the end of the method due to GC.KeepAlive (and the GC.KeepAlive is very important here to avoid race condition that could cause the resource cleanup during the native call). And yes, the code is still quite involved but the complexity is hidden inside the native layer which is a complicated layer by design. At least your users are safe and they won’t get heisenbugs due to very strange and hard to reproduce race conditions between their code and the GC finalization.\nConclusion\nThe main goal of this post is to scare you and convince that native resource management in .NET is tricky. You should clearly design the native-to-managed layer and rely on SafeHandle instead of manually managing the native resources. And you  definitely should not expose the native handles beyond such layer to avoid exposing the complexity through the entire application.\nCrazy territory: can the finalizer run before the constructor is done?\nHere is even crazier scenario. Is it possible to see “.dtor end” before “.ctor end”?\n\npublic class CrazyContructor\n{\n    public CrazyContructor()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\".ctor start\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\".ctor end\");\n    }\n    ~CazyConstructor()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\".dtor end\");\n    }\n}\n\nProbably, if you reached that far, you’re not surprised that answer is Yes! Constructor is not special for the GC. And if the constructor won’t touch this pointer and the this pointer is the last root for the instance, then the instance can be collected by the GC. And if the rest of the constructor will run for a long time and two GC cycles will happen at this point, the GC will run the finalizer technically before finishing the construction of the instance!\n\nHere is the full example:\npublic class CrazyContructor\n{\n    private readonly int _field;\n\tpublic CrazyContructor()\n\t{\n\t    Console.WriteLine(\".ctor start\");\n\t    _field = 42;\n\t    Console.WriteLine(_field);\n\t    // We’re not touching ‘this’ pointer after this point.\n\t    GC.Collect();\n\t    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\n\t    GC.Collect();\n\t    Console.WriteLine(\".ctor end\");\n\t}\n\t~CrazyContructor()\n\t{\n\t    Console.Write(\".dtor end\");\n\t}\n}\n\nAnd if you run just new CrazyConstructor(), you’ll get the following output:\n.ctor start\n42\n.dtor end.ctor end\n\n    var disqus_config = function () {\n      this.page.url = 'https://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/Blog/2025/03/27/Finalizers_are_tricker_than_you_might_think_p2.html';\n      this.page.identifier = 'https://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/Blog/2025/03/27/Finalizers_are_tricker_than_you_might_think_p2.html';\n    };\n\n    (function() {\n      var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');\n\n      s.src = 'https://dissecting-the-code.disqus.com/embed.js';\n\n      s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());\n      (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);\n    })();\n\n  Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=\"https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript\" rel=\"nofollow\">comments powered by Disqus.</a>",

      "en": "Finalizers in .NET can be more complicated than they seem, especially when managing native resources. Native resources are those not controlled by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and usually require manual allocation and cleanup via methods like constructors and destructors.\n\nFor example, the article discusses a class called `RocksDbWrapper`, which uses a native database resource. It implements the `IDisposable` interface to clean up resources but also includes a finalizer for safety. However, if the `Dispose` method is not called, the finalizer may run before the resource is actually used, leading to potential crashes.\n\nThe reason for this issue is that the garbage collector (GC) can collect local variables and instances during method calls if they are no longer in use. This means that if a method takes too long to execute, the GC might clean up resources that are still needed, causing instability.\n\nTo properly manage native resources, it is recommended to use `SafeHandle`, a special class designed to encapsulate native resources safely. This approach prevents race conditions and ensures that resources are not improperly cleaned up during their use.\n\nIn summary, managing native resources in .NET is tricky, and developers should use `SafeHandle` instead of relying on finalizers or manual cleanup to avoid hard-to-reproduce bugs and crashes.",

    "content": "Future PerfectInstalling air filters in classrooms has surprisingly large educational benefits$1,000 can raise a class’s test scores by as much as cutting class size by a third.by  Matthew YglesiasJan 9, 2020, 3:30 AM GMT+9FacebookLinkStudents at Lavrentyev Secondary School No 130 in Novosibirsk, Russia, on December 20, 2019. Kirill Kukhmar\\TASS via Getty ImagesAn emergency situation that turned out to be mostly a false alarm led a lot of schools in Los Angeles to install air filters, and something strange happened: Test scores went up. By a lot. And the gains were sustained in the subsequent year rather than fading away.That’s what NYU’s Michael Gilraine finds in a new working paper titled “Air Filters, Pollution, and Student Achievement” that looks at the surprising consequences of the Aliso Canyon gas leak in 2015.The impact of the air filters is strikingly large given what a simple change we’re talking about. The school district didn’t reengineer the school buildings or make dramatic education reforms; they just installed $700 commercially available filters that you could plug into any room in the country. But it’s consistent with a growing literature on the cognitive impact of air pollution, which finds that everyone from chess players to baseball umpires to workers in a pear-packing factory suffer deteriorations in performance when the air is more polluted.If Gilraine’s result holds up to further scrutiny, he will have identified what’s probably the single most cost-effective education policy intervention — one that should have particularly large benefits for low-income children.And while it’s too hasty to draw sweeping conclusions on the basis of one study, it would be incredibly cheap to have a few cities experiment with installing air filters in some of their schools to get more data and draw clearer conclusions about exactly how much of a difference this makes.The Aliso Canyon gas leak, explainedBack on October 23, 2015, employees of the Southern California Gas Company discovered a massive leak in the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility near Porter Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Significant for the larger purposes of the study, the Porter Ranch area is known for having “some of the cleanest air in the Valley year-round.”The gas leak was a huge catastrophe from the standpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, but also naturally raised concerns in the local community about the immediate impact on public health.Facing political pressure from concerned parents and teachers, Gilraine writes, “the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the owner of the gas well, the Southern California Gas Company, placed air filters in every classroom, office and common area in all schools within five miles of the gas leak at the end of January 2016.”Strikingly, however, air testing conducted around the time of the installation of the filters shows that the schools didn’t actually have abnormally high levels of the kinds of pollution that are normally associated with natural gas. Methane is lighter than air, and by the time the filters were installed — nearly three months after the leak — the extra pollution caused was all the way up in the sky and not affecting school buildings.Consequently, the installation of the filters served not to remove extra contamination caused by the leak, but simply to clean up the normal amount of background indoor air pollution present in the Valley. That lets Gilraine estimate the difference in student performance for schools just inside the boundary compared to those just outside.He finds that math scores went up by 0.20 standard deviations and English scores by 0.18 standard deviations, and the results hold up even when you control for “detailed student demographics, including residential ZIP Code fixed effects that help control for a student’s exposure to pollution at home.”For context, this is comparable in scale to some of the most optimistic studies on the potential benefits of smaller class sizes, with Alan Krueger finding that cutting class size by a third leads to a 0.22 standard deviation improvement in academic performance. Other studies find smaller or even negative effects (because adding teachers means bringing in less experienced or less effective ones), but even accepting the positive findings, it costs much more than $700 per classroom to achieve class size reductions of that scale.This is a big, but not implausible, numberThe effect Gilraine finds is strikingly large given that it’s a seemingly trivial intervention.But Sefi Roth of the London School of Economics studied university students’ test performance relative to air pollution levels on the day of the test alone. He found that taking a test in a filtered rather than unfiltered room would raise test scores by 0.09 standard deviations. That’s about half the impact Gilraine found, just based on day-of-test air quality. In Gilraine’s natural experiment, students benefited from cleaner air for about four months. Given that context, it’s not incredibly surprising that you could see an impact that’s about twice as large.What’s natural to ask — though unknowable from the study before us — is how much more change we could see if students benefited from an entire school year of clean air. Or perhaps an entire school career, from pre-K through high school graduation, of clean air.One striking thing about this is the government has long been aware that indoor air pollution is a potential problem. But according to currently prevailing Indoor Air Quality standards, there was nothing wrong with the air in the schools. Filters were installed because of an essentially unwarranted panic about natural gas.And while Los Angeles is a fairly high-pollution part of the country, outdoor particulate levels are higher in many areas — including New York, Chicago, and Houston — than they were in the impacted neighborhood. In other words, there’s no reason to think the impacted schools were unusually deficient in their air quality. They just happen to be the ones that installed filters.A cheap, scalable initiativeFor a sense of scale, Mathematica Policy Research’s best evidence on the effectiveness of the highly touted KIPP charter school network finds that after three years at KIPP there is significant improvement on three out of four test metrics — up 0.25 standard deviations on one English test, 0.22 standard deviations on another, and 0.28 standard deviations on one of two math tests.Those are big gains, and they help explain why there is so much enthusiasm about KIPP in some quarters, even as charter schools remain politically controversial and charters in general seem to produce roughly average results.This is bigger than the impact of letting kids benefit from clean air for four months. But installing the full suite of air filters costs about $1,000 per classroom, and continuing to operate them beyond the first year is cheaper than that. And best of all, unlike totally reworking school operations, it could be scaled up very quickly.It would be almost trivially easy to get a variety of school districts all around the country to randomly select schools for the installation of air filters. That would rapidly generate a ton of additional data, and if the results continued to be promising, the initiative could be made universal very quickly.The benefits, on their face, would be extremely large at a relatively low cost. And since air pollution is generally worse in lower-income communities, you would not only raise test scores nationally, but make progress on the big socioeconomic gaps in student achievement that have proven very difficult to remedy.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

If you currently have Xfinity, the NOW online signup is hidden, but when I called to cancel my Xfinity service on a date a couple weeks in the future, the NOW signup started working immediately. (I initially queried a neighbor's address to confirm that NOW was available in my area.)\nThe catch is that you can't use your own modem. They provide a free Arris TG1682P (also known as the XB3), but it's huge and uses more power (14.9 watts) than my Arris SB8200 (9.8 watts). I suspect they retired millions of these things and treat NOW as a recycling service.\nThe XB3 lets you enable bridge mode via the admin page at http://10.0.0.1/, and IPv4/IPv6 works just like a plain modem, but even in bridge mode, the gateway broadcasts several hidden SSIDs with no option to disable the radios.  Curiously I did not see an xfinitywifi broadcast, but your modem may vary.\nThe Hack\nI found reversible hardware mod to disable the WiFi radios.\nRefer to this disassembly video. There are 6 screws (2 hidden), lots of plastic prying, and you will probably wrinkle the rear sticker.\nMy circuit board is labeled TG1682/TG2472:\n\nNotice the two shielded WiFi modules.  The shields just pop off but you can leave them on.  In between is an 8-pin chip labeled \"54328\", a TPS54328 buck regulator.  The output pins connect to various pins on both Atheros WiFi chips. Pin 1 is EN/enable. It measures 3.3 volts, and when I connect it directly to ground, it sinks negligible current.\nSo that's the mod. Connect Pin 1 on the 54328 to anything grounded.  I used the far side of this nearby capacitor:\n\nThe XB3's idle power consumption dropped from 14.9 watts to 12.5 watts, the WiFi lights are off, and everything else seems to work via wired ethernet.  I notice that http://10.0.0.1/ is inaccessible (connection refused or HTTP 503) for a few minutes after booting, but it wakes up eventually.\nCaveats\nI don't actually know what circuit pulls up the EN pin, so it's possible that I'm overloading a digital output somewhere. I just measured amps to ground and saw a small number.  My first idea was to desolder/lift the pin, but I found that too difficult.\nThe XB3 uses an Intel Puma 6 chipset, which has been in the news over the years due to latency/jitter problems.  So far I'm not seeing anything weird on https://gfblip.appspot.com/ or https://speed.cloudflare.com/.",

    "content": "Finding the Best Sleep Tracker\n\n                    24 Mar, 2025\n\n    About 2 months ago I stumbled by this Bryan Johnson video on How I FIXED My Terrible Sleep - 10 Habits. I resolved that day to listen to Bryan and try to improve my sleep. But before we can improve it, first - how should we measure it? Bryan Johnson seems to use Whoop, but at that time I only had my Apple Watch (coupled with one of the popular sleep apps - AutoSleep). And then a long time ago I used and liked Oura. And I also had an order in for the new and fancy 8Sleep Pod 4 Ultra, which I was aware offers some sleep tracking too. So I found myself in a bit of a pickle - which one should I pick to track my sleep? And the answer of course is... to initiate a comprehensive tracking project to compare the 4 major candidates and find the. best. sleep. tracker. So that's what I did. This is me fully geared up and ready for bed:\n\nI've now gathered roughly 2 months of data. I kept the raw data in a simple spreadsheet, recording some of the basic measurements: the amount of sleep (Light, REM, Deep, and Awake tossing and turning), heart rate measurements (Resting Heart Rate (RHR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV)), and the sleep Score offered by each app. I'd log these every day right when I wake up so that I can compare and contrast the numbers and relate them to how I felt that morning. You can find my raw data in this spreadsheet, it looks like this:\n\nQualitative assessment. Now, to spare you some suspense, after 2 months of data collection and staring at the results basically every morning, it was very pretty easy to guess that Oura and Whoop are both \"Tier 1\" - fairly similar and quite high quality in their sleep tracking. They both give similar scores that also correlated with the way I felt in the morning most of the time. Next is 8Sleep, which is ok. And finally, I was sad to learn that Apple Watch + AutoSleep (which I had used in the past for many months) was really, really terrible. Its scores are basically almost random and they swing around wildly, with little correlation to how I felt in the morning in comparison.\nLet's now look at some of the data. First, let's look at the values that all 4 signals take on over the 2 months, with their histograms:\n\nAs we can see, AutoSleep and 8Sleep are way too easy to please, giving out really high scores and pushing against the 100 score boundary. Whoop is also a little too easy to please, giving out 100 scores. Oura is the most difficult to please, shows a relatively nice gaussian distribution of scores, and offering the most dynamic range. I take this to be a good and nice property of Oura. Indeed, after 2 months my highest ever score on Oura was 92, while I can get 100 on Whoop fairly regularly. This means that I can keep going and striving for even more optimal sleep, one day.\nNext, I was very curious about the correlation analysis between the trackers. We take all the scores and plot pairwise correlation scatter plots to see which of the trackers \"agree the most\" with each other. Here it is:\n\nAnd here are the correlations sorted:\nWhoop vs Oura: 0.65\nOura vs 8Sleep: 0.59\nOura vs AutoSleep: 0.47\n8Sleep vs AutoSleep: 0.42\nWhoop vs 8Sleep: 0.38\nWhoop vs AutoSleep: 0.14\n\nWhoop and Oura seem to enjoy the highest correlation at ~0.65, while the other trackers are a bit all over the place. In particular, Whoop and AutoSleep are almost uncorrelated (0.14!). If we think that Whoop is good (which I think it is), AutoSleep looks almost like a noise generator.\nMatters of Heart Rate. Next, I was interested to look at the Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). First, all trackers except 8Sleep agree quite highly on the heart rate during the night, including the Apple Watch. 8 Sleep is the worst because... it's a mattress so it doesn't have a direct measurement of the heart rate. I'm actually a bit impressed that it has a correlation this high:\n           AutoSleep    8Sleep      Oura     Whoop\nAutoSleep   1.000000  0.947151  0.908987  0.942587\n8Sleep      0.947151  1.000000  0.947977  0.878552\nOura        0.908987  0.947977  1.000000  0.904023\nWhoop       0.942587  0.878552  0.904023  1.000000\n\nHaving established that all 3 devices (Oura, Whoop, AutoSleep) give a good and consistent measurement of resting heart rate during the night, I was curious if there is a correlation with the sleep score, as this is something Bryan mentioned a few times in his videos. In other words, is a lower RHR associated with better sleep score? Keep in mind that this is just correlation analysis, indeed, I have no idea if the apps take RHR as one of the measurements when they calculate the sleep score. For Whoop, it seems like there is a tiny bit of a correlation, i.e. lower RHR comes with higher sleep score (~0.13).\n\nBut for Oura there is none:\n\nSo... I'm not sure what to make of this. Going in, I thought that lower RHR would correlate quite well to better score but this doesn't seem to be the case.\nLastly, during the 2 months of data collection I was exercising regularly, getting about 30 minutes on average of Zone 2 cardio every day, except twice a week also doing a 4x4x4 HIIT (4 min off, 4 min on, 4 times). I was curious if this showed up and indeed it seems like it does, pretty cool:\n\nUsing Whoop-Oura average measurement of both RHR and HRV, my resting heart rate has improved (decreased) by a bit less than 3 bpm over the duration of these 60 days (from ~51 bpm -> 48 ~bpm), which is awesome. In addition, my HRV has also improved (increased), (from ~49 -> 54). I love to see exercise adaptations in the data. For some unknown reason, notice also that the HRV values from Whoop seem to be inflated above those of Oura by about 5. I'm not exactly sure why, possibly they calculate it differently... but it's a bit surprising and unexplained.\nLastly, over the duration of 2 months I tried to improve my sleep quality, but it's all mixed up with a bunch of random events, parties, injuries, and also random experiments I tried to run here and there. As another example, my last week was rough because I was obsessed with a technical problem and couldn't sleep well. So unfortunately, overall, I am not seeing a dramatic increase in my sleep quality just yet. But I see this as a long-term project and I hope to increase these scores on average over the duration of the year. Maybe if squint hard enough my sleep has improved a tiny amount (?), but let's face it this is cope hah:\n\nYes, sleep matters. Overall, I will say with absolute certainty that Bryan is basically right, and my sleep scores correlate strongly with the quality of work I am able to do that day. When my score is low, I lack agency, I lack courage, I lack creativity, I'm simply tired. When my sleep score is high, I can power through anything. On my best days, I can sit down and work through 14 hours and barely notice the passage of time. It's not subtle. The effects are not a function of a single day's sleep but of the accumulated sleep debt over a duration of last few days. So in other words a single bad night is usually ok. But a few in a row is bad news. And vice versa. Listen to Bryan.\nShopping recommendations. Finally, I wanted to close with some recommendations to others who might want to undertake sleep tracking and improve their sleep.\n\nOura is Tier 1 / super solid tracker. The app is excellent and I love the single \"overview pane\" with all the data about that sleep (Whoop needs a lot more clicking around the app). I love that Oura score doesn't saturate that easily, that its scores are a gaussian, and that it has dynamic range. Unfortunately, I find the ring form factor quite inconvenient because it's a little thick, and fingers are used extensively (e.g. hand washing, food preparation, etc.) When I go to the gym, I find myself removing the ring often because it interferes with my grip strength, and it could get scratched. The ring has to be sized correctly and your finger changes its size. Sometimes it's a little too snug, sometimes a little too loose. The ring also has to be rotated correctly for the best results (the notch has to be down), so you'll keep finding it rotated wrong and correcting it. I also don't love having to take the ring on and off to charge it.\n\nWhoop is also a Tier 1 / super solid tracker. The app is excellent. It can be a bit overwhelming at first and requires quite a bit of moving around, but it is very comprehensive, full-featured and customizable, more than Oura. It also has a pretty neat and useful LLM integration. I also really like the Community feature, though it is severely undercooked, under-designed, and feels orphaned. I think Oura has a better \"grand overview\" page for a single dense summary of one night of sleep. I don't like that Whoop saturates at 100 fairly easily. I find that Whoop is significantly better when it comes to the form factor. Having the tracker on your wrist is just so significantly easier and less intrusive into your daily life. In addition, you never have to take it off because the charger attaches on and off onto it!\n\nI didn't find 8Sleep to be very reliable in its sleep tracking. The scores don't make as much sense to me when I wake up, and as we saw above they don't correlate very strongly with Whoop or Oura.\n\nAutoSleep is basically a random number generator. Maybe there is a better app on Apple Watch for sleep tracking, but I haven't found it. Do not use.\n\nAbove: The 4 apps. Left to right: Oura - I love this \"grand overview\" summary page, it's dense with just the info you want, and it's super easy to swipe left/right for other days. Whoop - less dense, you have to move around a lot to \"treasure hunt\" the information you want. 8Sleep - pretty decent. AutoSleep - looks cool but the numbers are all wrong so ¯\\(ツ)/¯.\nSummarizing all of that into my advice right now: Get Whoop for 9.5/10, reliable, convenient sleep tracking with an excellent app (once you get to know it a bit). Get Oura for 10/10 tracking, if you're ok with the ring form factor.\nDid I skip your favorite obviously best sleep tracker?

      "en": "### Summary: Finding the Best Sleep Tracker\n\nTwo months ago, I decided to improve my sleep after watching a video by Bryan Johnson. I needed a way to measure my sleep quality, so I compared four sleep trackers: Oura, Whoop, 8Sleep, and Apple Watch with AutoSleep.\n\nAfter collecting data for two months, I found that Oura and Whoop are the best trackers, providing consistent and high-quality sleep scores that matched how I felt in the morning. 8Sleep performed decently, but Apple Watch + AutoSleep was the least reliable, giving random scores that didn’t correlate with my sleep quality.\n\nKey Findings:\n- **Oura and Whoop**: Both are top-tier trackers with similar scores and good correlation (0.65).\n- **8Sleep**: Fairly decent but not as reliable as Oura or Whoop.\n- **AutoSleep**: Not recommended; scores seem arbitrary and unreliable.\n\nIn terms of heart rate measurements, Oura, Whoop, and AutoSleep provided consistent results, while 8Sleep was less reliable due to its mattress nature. I noticed improvements in my resting heart rate and heart rate variability after regular exercise, but my overall sleep quality fluctuated due to various life events.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Best Choice**: **Whoop** for its convenience and comprehensive features (9.5/10).\n- **Alternative Choice**: **Oura** for superior tracking accuracy, if you don't mind wearing a ring (10/10).\n- **Avoid**: **AutoSleep** due to unreliable tracking; consider finding a better Apple Watch app.\n\nIn conclusion, quality sleep is crucial for productivity. My sleep scores significantly affect my daily performance, emphasizing the importance of tracking and improving sleep quality over time.",

    "content": "By Sergey Tselovalnikov on 31 March 2025There is no Vibe EngineeringYou've probably heard about \"vibe coding\" by now. The term was recently coined by Andrej Karpathy in his tweet. Andrej defines Vibe Coding as \"a new kind of coding, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists\". The key difference between vibe coding and normal coding is that the engineer doesn’t interact with the codebase directly, and instead converses with the agent and inspects the final outcome.\nThe term caught on and Twitter quickly flooded with posts about how AI has radically transformed coding and will soon replace all software engineers. While AI undeniably impacts the way we write code, it hasn't fundamentally changed our role as engineers. Allow me to explain.\n\nWhen the tornado comes whipping through your neighborhood and your house gets blown down and somehow you didn’t have insurance and you lose everything, you can’t control that. But you can certainly control how you’re gonna react to that situation.— Clancy Gilroy\nCoding vs Engineering\nLet’s start by clearly defining what a software engineer’s role entails, and to the surprise of some people, software engineering is not writing code. Yet even highly technical people often conflate coding and engineering. The most concise and precise definition of software engineering I've encountered is:\nSoftware engineering is programming integrated over time— Software Engineering at Google: Lessons Learned from Programming Over Time\nThe integrated over time part is crucial. It highlights that software engineering isn't simply writing a functioning program but building a system that successfully serves the needs, can scale to the demand, and is able to evolve over its complete lifespan.\nHowever, similarly to normal coding, vibe coding only covers coding at a single point in time. If an agent is used to generate a quick prototype and validate it with tests, that’s coding – not engineering. Engineering means designing systems capable of withstanding real-world conditions, sustaining workloads, resisting security threats, migrating and supporting users’ data in the system, and adapting to new requirements often many years down the line.\nVibe coding is interacting with the codebase via prompts. As the implementation is hidden from the \"vibe coder\", all the engineering concerns will inevitably get ignored. Many of the concerns are hard to express in a prompt, and many of them are hard to verify by only inspecting the final artifact. Historically, all engineering practices have tried to shift all those concerns left – to the earlier stages of development when they’re cheap to address. Yet with vibe coding, they’re shifted very far to the right – when addressing them is expensive.\nThe question of whether an AI system can perform the complete engineering cycle and build and evolve software the same way a human can remains open. However, there are no signs of it being able to do so at this point, and if it one day happens, it won’t have anything to do with vibe coding – at least the way it’s defined today.\nThe real Vibe Engineering\nAs a thought experiment, we can consider whether it’s possible to engineer reliable systems composed entirely of \"vibe-coded\" components. After all, less reliable consumer hardware once replaced mainframes, and we learned how to build reliable systems from inherently unreliable parts.\nSuch systems could tightly encapsulate AI-generated black-box components with rigorous testing, detailed performance profiling, tracing, canary deployments, and strict protocol compatibility checks. In other words, the systems would employ the same rigorous engineering practices that underpin today's software – but likely much, much stricter.\nIn such a future, every engineer essentially becomes a mix of an architect and a platform engineer. We could even coin the term \"Vibe Engineering\" for this new role – but its definition would ultimately be the same as traditional software engineering. So, there is no distinct \"Vibe Engineering\" – just software engineering, perhaps involving less code typing than before.\nWhen might this future arrive? It's uncertain. A good indicator, however, might be when engineers confidently say \"yes\" to the question: \"Would you happily go on-call for a system of fully AI-generated services?\". So far, the answer seems to be a predominant \"no\".\nConclusion\nVibe Coding as a practice is here to stay. It works, and it solves real-world problems – getting you from zero to a working prototype in hours. Yet, at the moment, it isn’t suitable for building production-grade software.\nIt is possible that there’ll be a future where software is built from vibe-coded blocks, but the work of designing software able to evolve and scale doesn’t go away. That’s not vibe engineering – that’s just engineering, even if the coding part of it will look a bit different.\nThank you for reading.SubscribeI'll be sending an email every time I publish a new post.SubscribeOr, subscribe with RSS.",

The prize is awarded to only a few researchers per year for achievements in physics, chemistry, and “physiology or medicine.”1 Nobel laureates hold immense prestige and wield influence not only within their fields but also within the broader public sphere. Nearly every scientist, at some point in their career, dreams of winning a Nobel, even if just as an overconfident undergraduate student. But for some, the prize is more than merely a dream: it’s an obsession.Published in 1981, Nicholas Wade’s The Nobel Duel recounts how endocrinologists Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin discovered peptide hormones produced by the hypothalamus, earning each of them a 1/4 share of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.2 But more than this, Wade’s book details an intensely bitter rivalry, shaped not only by the personalities of the characters involved but by the incentives of the system in which they worked. More than forty years later, The Nobel Duel remains a valuable cautionary tale about the competitive pressures that shape scientific discoveries.Hypothetical HormonesBefore diving into Schally and Guillemin, it’s helpful to learn a bit about the hypothalamus, the subject of their scientific struggles. The hypothalamus is a small lump of brain tissue, about the size of a hazelnut, that sits about seven centimeters behind the nose.3Despite its small size, the hypothalamus serves an important role as a regulatory center for hormonal signaling. It controls the pituitary gland, for example, another small tissue nodule located directly underneath it. The hypothalamus responds to nerve signals from the brain and stimulates the pituitary to release hormones that act on the rest of the body. This pathway controls a wide variety of critical processes, including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and stress response. The hypothalamus plays an integral role in reproductive biology, too, controlling everything from the production of sex hormones to ovulation and the menstrual cycle.The hypothalamus sits deep in the brain, right next to the pituitary glands. Credit: OpenStaxIn rabbits, where ovulation is triggered by sexual intercourse, the hypothalamus converts the neural signal (female orgasm) into a hormonal signal (luteinizing hormone release by the pituitary) causing the ovaries to release eggs. This was discovered in a set of groundbreaking experiments in the 1930s,4 but the mechanism remained unclear for decades. How, exactly, does the hypothalamus communicate between the brain and the pituitary?An obvious hypothesis would be that the hypothalamus controls the pituitary via nerve signals. However, although the hypothalamus sits immediately adjacent to the pituitary, anatomists were unable to identify any nerves that could plausibly be responsible.5 In the 1940s and 50s, the English physiologist Geoffrey Harris conducted a set of experiments to test an alternative hypothesis: namely, that a small molecule, rather than a physical neural connection, might be responsible.Working in rats, Harris carefully severed a set of tiny blood vessels connecting the hypothalamus and pituitary and showed that the rats stopped reproducing. Harris proposed that the hypothalamus sends its own hormones through these blood vessels, triggering the pituitary to release its own set of hormones. But until such hormones could be directly identified, many scientists met this idea with skepticism. In order to explain the regulation of all the different hormones of the anterior pituitary, Harris had to hypothesize not just one hypothalamic hormone, but a whole set of them. And after all, Occam’s Razor states that “entities are not to be multiplied without necessity.” Even for Harris, this hypothesis was a leap into the unknown.Sign up for Asimov Press!SubscribeStress and StrifeRoger Guillemin and Andrew Schally were no strangers to stress, even early in their lives. And in an ironic coincidence, it was stress itself that sparked their acrimonious race to discover the hormones of the hypothalamus.Guillemin, born in 1924, grew up in the French town of Dijon. The Nazi occupation interrupted his medical studies, but after the war, he found a position in Montreal, where he completed his PhD under professor Hans Selye, studying the stress response mediated by the pituitary and adrenal glands.Unfortunately, Guillemin clashed with his advisor. As another of Selye’s students, Claude Fortier, put it, the two men were occasionally “in complete and total disagreement in our intellectual approach to research.”6 Although Guillemin finished his PhD in Selye’s lab, he was eager to search for a job elsewhere. In 1953, he secured an assistant professorship at Baylor College of Medicine and began setting up his own lab.When a colleague at Baylor, professor Charles Pomerat, complained to Guillemin that pituitary cells did not produce hormones when cultured in vitro, Guillemin saw an opportunity to test Harris’ hypothesis. With the help of one of Pomerat’s students, Barry Rosenberg, Guillemin repeated the experiment. As before, the cells did not produce hormones in culture. But Guillemin took the experiment a step further, adding a piece of tissue from the hypothalamus to the culture dish with the pituitary cells. If Harris’ hypothesis was correct, the hypothalamus hormones would cause the pituitary cells to resume their own hormone production.In particular, Guillemin noticed that ACTH, a pituitary hormone that mediates the response of the adrenal glands to stress, was only produced in the presence of hypothalamus tissue. Since no nerves were formed between the hypothalamus and pituitary cells in the cell culture, this interaction had to be hormonal. Guillemin immediately published his work, but to his consternation, he soon saw that he wasn’t the only one who had made this groundbreaking observation. As The Nobel Duel describes it, “The experience was like planting a flag at the top of Everest only to see, as the mist cleared, that another flag was being erected by somebody else.”That somebody else was Andrzej (Andrew) Schally. Born in Wilno, Poland7 in 1926, Schally was the son of Kazimierz Schally, a general in the Polish Army. When Germany and Russia invaded and occupied Poland in 1939, many Polish soldiers escaped to Romania, Schally’s family among them. Andrew Schally survived the Nazi and Soviet occupations and then moved to the United Kingdom after the war, where he studied chemistry. By that time, he already displayed “a sort of manic persistence” for scientific research, his old supervisor recalled. In 1952, Schally moved to McGill University in Montreal, where he would eventually earn his PhD. Together with his advisor, professor Murray Saffran, Schally showed that samples of rat pituitary tissue cultured in vitro would produce ACTH only in the presence of a substance, which Saffran named “corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF),” found in the hypothalamus.8Schally’s study was published in the journal Endocrinology in October 1955. Guillemin’s paper was published in the following issue of the same journal. Now, suddenly, both scientists were aware of the other’s work; their race began in earnest. Both scientists, importantly, viewed CRF as “their discovery,” and each aimed to make it the central focus of an illustrious academic career. While both had shown that a hypothalamus hormone exists, neither knew what that hormone actually was. The next step was to isolate the hormone, purify it, and determine its structure. With the molecular biology tools available in 1955, however, such a feat was much easier said than done.Thus began a 26-year marathon.Roger Guillemin (left) and Andrew Schally (right).Brains, Brains, BrainsThere were three main challenges in determining the structure of CRF: the hormones are made only in minute concentrations, the hypothalamus is small, and the analytical techniques of the time were not very sensitive. Instead of developing new analytical methods, Guillemin and Schally instead mounted a straightforward, brute-force attack on CRF.At first, the two scientists worked together, embarking on their research using “state-of-the-art” technology available to biochemists in 1955. But to describe these methods as “old-school” would be extremely charitable. The duo began by using chemical methods such as salt precipitation to try to purify CRF from puréed hypothalamus. This was similar to Edwin Cohn’s successful fractionation of blood into albumin and other proteins during World War II (a story previously told in Asimov Press). However, albumin is the most abundant protein in blood plasma, whereas CRF is present in the hypothalamus in only trace amounts.In a biochemistry lab class as an undergraduate, I got a small taste of the difficulties these researchers faced as I labored to purify lactate dehydrogenase from beef heart using salt precipitation and Sephadex ion-exchange chromatography.9 Grinding up a beef heart in a blender was not a pleasant experience, and even then, I was only able to isolate less than a milligram of lactate dehydrogenase — one of the most abundant proteins in the heart. These days, it’s much easier to produce proteins by recombinant expression in bacteria, but that technology did not become available until the 1970s. So instead, Schally and Guillemin were forced to grind up literally millions of animal hypothalami, dissected from hundreds of tons of brains, and carefully separate them into their constituent molecules. Each fraction had to be assayed for hormone activity, and at first, the only way to measure this was by injecting it into animals and waiting multiple days to monitor a response.10From 1957 to 1962, Schally performed his research in Guillemin’s lab at Houston. Since Guillemin specialized in physiology and Schally in biochemistry, they formed a complementary pair. However, their search for the structure of CRF bore little fruit, and resentment began to grow between them. Guillemin was the lab head, which meant that he was able to pursue more productive avenues of research, even setting up a second lab in France and splitting his time between Paris and Houston. By contrast, Schally toiled for up to 18 hours per day on the CRF project, tediously isolating fractions without much success. As Schally saw it, “[Guillemin] wanted me to take the blame when things went wrong and to take the credit for himself when things went right … An equal partner I could be with him, but he wanted me to be his slave.”The tipping point came at a conference in late 1961 organized by the NIH Endocrinology Study Section, a major funder of Schally and Guillemin. The endocrinologist tasked with summarizing the presentations, Roy Greep, was clearly unimpressed by the lack of progress in actually isolating and characterizing CRF, writing: “never before to my knowledge, except for the monster of Loch Ness and the Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, has the existence of hypothetical objects been indicated by so much imposing circumstantial evidence.”Having CRF likened to the Loch Ness Monster struck a nerve. Nearly five years had been spent, and although Schally and Guillemin had made a small amount of progress, they still had not achieved their primary aim of determining the hormone’s structure. In private letters, Schally accused Guillemin of supplying him with inadequate materials, and Guillemin responded by suggesting Schally’s poor biochemical work was to blame. Not long after, Schally began looking for other positions, eventually obtaining a job at Tulane University in New Orleans. By the end of 1962, Guillemin and Schally had publicly fallen out, and Schally started setting up his own lab.To compete with Guillemin, Schally needed a lot of brains — and not just metaphorically. Each experiment required tens of thousands of hypothalami to isolate minute quantities of hormones. Guillemin favored sheep hypothalami11 and purchased well over two million of them from slaughterhouses in France over the course of his lab’s work. Schally instead opted to use pig hypothalami, for two reasons: First, by using pigs instead of sheep, if Guillemin beat him to the discovery of a hormone, Schally’s work would not be completely wasted since hormones in different species are not necessarily the same. More importantly, Schally established a plentiful source of pig brains through a connection with Oscar Mayer, the meat-packing company that slaughtered ten thousand pigs per day. In the end, Schally’s work on the hypothalamic hormones would consume more than one million pig hypothalami, provided by Oscar Mayer free of charge.Troubles with TRFWith Guillemin and Schally now leading separate laboratories, a vicious competition began. In the beginning, both men had focused on CRF, since it was the only hypothalamic hormone for which a good measurement assay was known. However, five years of unsuccessful attempts to determine the structure of CRF had convinced both to seek an easier target. Shortly after Schally left his lab, Guillemin made an important advance by developing an accurate assay for thyrotropin releasing factor (TRF), a hormone that coaxes the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).12 The new assay opened up TRF as a target for isolation, starting a race to characterize its structure in addition to CRF.Although Guillemin had a head start in this race, he was unable to maintain his early lead. Solving the structure of TRF was basically a biochemical problem, and since Guillemin was not a biochemist himself, he relied on others to perform the experiments. Despite their help, though, Guillemin looked down on the biochemists he worked with, neglecting to properly credit them for their work. This “inability to work with others on an equal basis” was what drove away not only Andrew Schally but also a succession of biochemists — first Marian Jutisz (who performed much of the initial work on TRF) and, later, Wylie Vale and Roger Burgus, two of Guillemin’s star proteges. Guillemin also clashed with administrators at the Collège de France, which led him to move all his work back to Houston. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Schally was busy grinding up pig hypothalami. His goal was simple: to prepare a sufficient quantity of pure TRF for structural determination. But in practice, this was deceptively complex.Roger Guillemin in his laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences.After four years of painstaking work, Schally and Guillemin had both nearly succeeded, but astonishingly, both made the same wrong turn, erroneously concluding that TRF is not a peptide due to faulty experiments. Guillemin’s laboratory, for example, extracted TRF molecules from 500,000 sheep, but found that it only contained 8 percent amino acids by mass. Unaware of his mistake, Guillemin trumpeted this result as a breakthrough. Schally came closer but still missed the mark. He found three amino acids in his hypothalami — histidine, glutamic acid, and proline — but was unable to determine the sequence in which they were linked, and worse, falsely concluded that they made up only 30 percent of the TRF molecule. With the remaining 70 percent unknown, Schally could only guess at the molecule’s identity.13 (It’s now known that TRF is a peptide, meaning it is made entirely of amino acids.)Throughout this time, both labs were not only busy with science but also with undermining each other. They would slight each other at conferences, downplay each other’s contributions in review articles, refuse to share materials, and send passive-aggressive letters. After a conference at which Guillemin had allegedly disparaged Schally, Schally wrote: “Your somewhat derogatory and deprecating remarks . . . surprised me as the attack on Pearl Harbor surprised the U.S. Navy”.Guillemin replied with a calculated riposte: “I have no comments except to say that I am neither your conscience nor your psychiatrist.”Overall, it appears that Guillemin took up a strategy of subtly provoking Schally, whose angry reactions made him look like the aggressor. Guillemin would alternate between public attacks and private reconciliations. Writing to Schally, he claimed “there have never been any bad feelings on my part toward your laboratory, your group of collaborators, or yourself.” But a few months later, he was back on the attack, ridiculing Schally in a review article. As a junior scientist in Guillemin’s lab observed, “Neither one could stand the other’s guts. Every time a letter was sent from one lab to the other there was usually some kind of terse reply. But Schally usually ended up looking like the heavy because he was not as clever as Guillemin.”Besides the winner-takes-all nature of their race, another major driver of conflict was the fact that Guillemin viewed Schally as his junior.14 As Nicholas Wade writes, Guillemin “could never bring himself to accept that Schally was not a child but a scientific colleague of approximately equal, if different, abilities.” After Schally left Guillemin’s lab and started out on his own, the prospect of Schally succeeding as an independent researcher was a threat to Guillemin’s psyche. Meanwhile, Schally was fed up with Guillemin’s attempts to belittle him. He could not accept anything less than an equal standing with Guillemin, and was determined to prove himself superior to his former supervisor, even if this required ungentlemanly tactics.15Within their own labs, both Schally and Guillemin played up the growing rivalry in an attempt to motivate their subordinates: if the other lab scooped them, it would mean disaster for their careers.16 However, on the rare occasions they faced a common threat, such as a third researcher calling into question their prior work on CRF, the two labs did move to defend each other. Still, the overall attitude was one of steadily escalating hostility.By 1968, the structure of TRF was still unsolved, and the broader endocrinology community was losing patience. As Nicholas Wade summarizes:Guillemin and Schally had achieved nothing. Noisy claims and mutual abuse could not forever substitute for real progress. Indeed, the lack of progress, the skeptics argued, raised pointedly the question of whether the releasing factors really existed.While Schally and Guillemin traded inimical letters and slighted each other in review articles, the NIH, which funded both labs, was coming close to withdrawing its support. According to Murray Saffran, who at that time was a member of the NIH Endocrinology Study Section, “Their support was on the brink because they were chasing each other rather than the real problem.” In January 1969, the Endocrinology Study Section held a conference in Tucson, Arizona, at which both labs were expected to showcase their results. If their progress was found unsatisfactory, it would surely mean the end of the scientific careers of both Guillemin and Schally.Showdown at TucsonUnbeknownst to the Endocrinology Study Section, Guillemin’s student Roger Burgus had in fact made progress towards deciphering the structure of TRF. Using newly developed analytical methods (including NMR and mass spectrometry) over a three-year span, Burgus had amassed enough data to conclude that TRF was in fact a peptide, and that histidine, glutamic acid, and proline made up at least 80 percent of it. Finally, the research was back on track.But at the conference, Guillemin was faced with a dilemma. Should he announce his lab’s progress, or wait to reveal it until his lab had completely solved the puzzle? Making an announcement would help prove to the NIH that his funding was worthwhile. But it would also tip Schally off, and risk Guillemin’s getting scooped. Guillemin decided to make the announcement, which, while saving his scientific career, set off a furious sprint to nail down the structure of TRF. Building upon Burgus’s results, Guillemin ordered the Swiss chemical company Hoffmann-La Roche to synthesize all six possible tripeptides containing histidine, glutamic acid, and proline, as well as versions of these peptides with an acetyl group attached to the N-terminus. In early 1969, Burgus tested these candidates for TRF activity, seeing if they could stimulate the pituitary to release thyroid-stimulating hormone. Excitingly, he found that his sample of acetyl-glu-his-pro behaved like a weaker form of TRF. Guillemin quickly published this result in the French journal Comptes Rendus, and also submitted it to Science — which rejected the manuscript because a French-speaking reviewer noticed that it had already been published elsewhere!Meanwhile, Schally was also getting close, finding that the sequence of amino acids in TRF was glu-his-pro, and that the peptide lacked a free N-terminal amino group and C-terminal carboxyl group, which meant that there were chemical modifications at these sites. At that point, the nature of these modifications was still unknown, but Schally guessed that the N-terminus had a fatty acid attached,17 and the C-terminus had an amide group attached. Schally instructed his collaborator, Franz Enzmann, to add these chemical modifications to the glu-his-pro peptide. Schally was delighted to find that three different modified versions of glu-his-pro all had TRF-like activity.Remarkably, both research groups had been saved by the same unexpected side reaction. Under the conditions used to synthesize the modified peptides, glutamic acid present at the N-terminus will spontaneously cyclize to form pyroglutamic acid. By June 1969, both labs had realized that the TRF activity in their samples was due to a side product, pyro-glu-his-pro-amide. But was this compound actually the same as TRF?Here, Schally and Guillemin drew different conclusions. Guillemin equivocated, writing that although pyro-glu-his-pro-amide behaved very similarly to TRF, the actual structure of TRF was still “an open question.” By contrast, Schally’s collaborators Karl Folkers and Franz Enzmann had painstakingly compared the properties of synthetic pyro-glu-his-pro-amide and natural TRF in seventeen different assays, leading them to the correct conclusion: the compounds were identical. Although Guillemin’s lab soon reached the same result, Schally’s team had won the seven-year race — by a margin of just thirty-seven days.In determining the structure of TRF, Schally had scored a victory over Guillemin. But to the wider community, it looked more like a draw — an interpretation also espoused by Guillemin in several review articles. The main result of the race was that the theory of hypothalamic releasing factors was no longer in doubt. But TRF was only one of the many releasing factors thought to exist. So with CRF and other hormones still left to identify, Guillemin and Schally continued their work in an attempt to achieve a clear-cut victory.LRF: the Second LapLuteinizing hormone releasing factor, or LRF,18 had long been a target of researchers due to its crucial role in reproduction. As far back as the 1930s, animal breeding experiments had revealed that the hypothalamus controls the release of reproductive hormones from the pituitary. In fact, these results were what first led British neuroendocrinologist, Geoffrey Harris, to propose the existence of hypothalamus-derived hormones. So unlike TRF, which was mainly of niche interest, LRF had attracted much more attention. Determining its structure would be an advance with important applications in reproductive medicine.After finally succeeding with TRF, both Schally and Guillemin were eager to be first to make this discovery.However, this time the field was crowded, as several other researchers, including Harris himself, were already hard at work on the same problem.Those other researchers, however, lacked two crucial things: a fanatical obsession to be first, and an industrial-scale source of hypothalamus tissue. Only Guillemin and Schally would go “all-in,” and labs that did not devote 100 percent of their effort to solving the structure of LRF quickly fell behind. By virtue of having a decade-long head start, Geoffrey Harris came close, but he was hindered by his reliance on an LRF assay which was highly accurate yet slow to perform. Schally and Guillemin used assays that were less accurate but much more rapid, allowing them to optimize their procedures for isolating LRF.Just as the race for LRF began to heat up, Schally was handicapped by a previous problem stemming from the last stages of the battle for TRF. To come out ahead of Guillemin, Schally had collaborated with the chemists Folkers and Enzmann, and the physiologist Dr. Cyril Bowers. However, Schally was reluctant to give them the credit they deserved, leading to a breakdown in the collaboration. When Folkers and Enzmann filed their own patent on synthetic TRF, Schally was outraged. And worse, Folkers approached Oscar Mayer, asking for a cut of the cheap hypothalami that had thus far been going solely to Schally. Thus, Folkers and Bowers went from being collaborators to competitors.Fortunately for Schally, Guillemin was also delayed due to moving his lab from Houston to a better-funded position at the Salk Institute in San Diego. When his research resumed in 1970, Guillemin’s student Roger Burgus quickly identified that LRF contained nine amino acids, but lacked enough material to determine the order in which they were arranged. Extracting and purifying more LRF would take time.Then came a shock. In February 1971, Guillemin was organizing the Endocrine Society’s annual conference and received a list of abstracts of conference applicants. Among these was one from Schally, which reported that LRF contained the same nine amino acids. Clearly, Schally had progressed at least as far as Guillemin’s team had. Seeing the abstract also placed Guillemin in considerable political danger: he was now vulnerable to accusations of obtaining an unfair advantage from seeing Schally’s unpublished work. Deciding to clear up the matter, Guillemin wrote a letter to Schally explaining that Burgus had independently discovered the same thing. Schally countered: if Guillemin knew the nine amino acids of LRF, then why hadn’t he submitted his own conference abstract?However, although neither lab realized it, both had made the same mistake. LRF actually contains ten amino acids, not nine. The method they were using to break up LRF into its amino acids involved treatment with acid, and this happened to degrade the amino acid tryptophan. Having just a little more LRF available for analysis would enable a full structural determination, but this would require laborious extraction from huge amounts of tissue. By 1971, “the gift of a few millionths of a gram of LRF to either side would have tipped the balance.”Once again, Schally came out ahead, but was able to do so only through the help of three Japanese researchers, Akira Arimura, Yoshihiko Baba, and Hisayuki Matsuo, who had joined his team to share their biochemical expertise. Initially, despite processing 160,000 hypothalami, Schally had only obtained 250 micrograms of LRF, a quantity too small for traditional peptide analysis. But Matsuo saved the day, devising an ingenious scheme to cleave the LRF into smaller fragments, and then analyze the fragments without first separating them. Although this analysis still left some ambiguity in the hormone’s structure, it narrowed it down to two candidate peptides, which Matsuo synthesized. Arimura, using a new radioimmunoassay he’d developed (based on a previous technique invented by Rosalyn Yalow), found that one of them had the same biological activity as LRF.Schally had won again, but this time, he was determined to make it an unforgettable victory. The large Endocrine Society conference was due to be held in June 1971, but a smaller conference took place earlier in May. At this earlier conference, Schally instructed his lab members to show data proving that they had made synthetic LRF, but not to reveal the structure unless Guillemin had also solved it. Although Schally’s students — and the conference audience — were bitter about this gag order, the purpose was clear: to provoke Guillemin.At the Endocrine Society conference, Schally personally delivered the coup de grace. Guillemin was moderating a session on releasing factors, and all of the major players in the field were in attendance. First, Roger Burgus presented the work he had performed for Guillemin, and crucially, he still claimed that LRF had only nine amino acids. When Schally presented the true structure of LRF, the crowd went wild. As Karl Folkers, who was in attendance, described it, “That must have been perhaps the worst thing that ever happened to Guillemin.”19Somatostatin: Schally StumblesGuillemin, however, would soon score a victory of his own with the discovery of somatostatin. One of the many roles of the pituitary is to produce growth hormone. By analogy with the other releasing factors, it was thought that this process was regulated by a growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) from the hypothalamus. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Schally’s lab worked to isolate GRF from pig hypothalami. Although this project was paused several times due to the races for other factors, by 1971, Schally had found a ten amino acid peptide which he tentatively identified as GRF.However, Schally had made a massive mistake. In isolating GRF, he relied on a simple yet inaccurate assay, based on measuring rat bone growth. In the race for LRF, choosing a simple assay instead of a more accurate yet more complicated one had been crucial for success. But now the opposite was true. Schally had neglected to validate his results using a more accurate assay. As it turned out, the peptide that he thought was GRF was actually just a degradation product of pig hemoglobin that happened to give positive results in the rat bone growth assay.Meanwhile, another scientist, Ladislav Krulich, was also hard at work studying the hypothalamic regulation of growth hormone. But instead of a releasing factor, he noticed that the hypothalamus produced a molecule (which he termed GIF) that inhibited the release of growth hormone. Although Roger Guillemin, like Schally, had initially been chasing GRF, a chance discovery by his student Paul Brazeau led him to reconsider. In early 1972, Brazeau tested hypothalamic extracts for their ability to promote growth hormone release but found that they inhibited the release instead. At first, Guillemin was incredulous, but then he remembered Krulich’s reports of GIF. Soon, Roger Burgus had isolated a large amount of GIF from hypothalamic extracts which were left over from the race for LRF. Within a year, Guillemin’s team had determined the structure: a cyclic peptide of fourteen amino acids.Finally, Guillemin was victorious. And like Schally before him, he was determined to make his victory count. First, he renamed GIF to somatostatin, a name which is still in use to this day. In changing the name, he also diminished the contributions of Krulich who had been the first to propose the existence of GIF. Furthermore, Guillemin downplayed the role of his own students in carrying out the GIF project. In a 1974 editorial he wrote for the New England Journal of Medicine, he extolled the medical potential of somatostatin but left out Burgus and Vale from the author list, and failed to cite Krulich even once. By contrast, Guillemin took care to cite the barely related work of Rolf Luft, a Swedish endocrinologist who just happened to be on the Nobel Prize committee.The Prize and Its PriceAfter Schally’s discovery of LRF and Guillemin’s discovery of somatostatin, each knew they were in the running for a Nobel Prize. Starting from their first experiments in 1955, they both had made major contributions to endocrinology and validated Harris’ theory of hypothalamic releasing factors. Harris had died in 1971, so he was ineligible for the Nobel (the award is not given posthumously). Schally and Guillemin were considered to be front-runners in the field and had shared a Lasker award in 1975. However, their chance at a Nobel was not assured. After all, the prize committee could only honor one area of research per year, which meant that endocrinology was competing with exciting new advances, such as recombinant DNA.20 To boost their chances for a Nobel, both Guillemin and Schally cultivated relationships with prominent Swedish scientists.In October 1977, the call from Stockholm came. Guillemin and Schally would each receive a 1/4 share of the Nobel. The remaining half would go to Rosalyn Yalow, a biochemist who had developed an extremely sensitive assay for hormones that made Schally’s and Guillemin’s work possible.21 Guillemin, feigning humility, proclaimed that his research goal had been to treat the sick, not to win the Nobel. Schally was more forthright, admitting that “pride and ambition have a lot to do with whatever I have achieved.” Pride and ambition, yes, but also a singular obsession. As Nicholas Wade observes:No brilliant scientific insights, no high exercise of intellect or imagination was required in their endeavor, just years of extreme determination and the tenacity to grind up tons of brain tissue.Ironically, the Nobel that Schally and Guillemin shared was for “Physiology or Medicine,” yet the key to their work had been chemistry. Both laureates had relied heavily on chemists in their lab. For Guillemin, Roger Burgus served as the key player in the purification and structural determination of TRF, LRF, and somatostatin. Without Burgus, Guillemin would have had no chance of a Nobel. Schally, unlike Guillemin, had expertise in chemistry and performed his own peptide purification. But he still relied heavily on other chemists for structure determination — Enzmann and Folkers for TRF, and Matsuo for LRF. However, both then and now, scientific credit goes to the lab chief, not to his subordinates.The 1977 Nobel Prize awards in Oslo, Norway. From left to right: John Hasbrouck van Vleck (physics), Sir Nevill Mott (physics), Philip Warren Anderson (physics), Ilya Prigogine (chemistry), Rosalyn Yalow (medicine), Roger Guillemin (medicine), Andrew Schally (medicine), Bertil Ohlin (economic sciences) and James Meade (economic sciences).And many of Guillemin’s subordinates resented the way their chief treated them. The New England Journal of Medicine editorial on somatostatin marked the starting point of a breakup of Guillemin’s lab. Burgus and Vale, who had been left off the author list, realized that Guillemin had gone too far in arrogating credit to himself. Worse, Guillemin began playing Vale and Burgus against one another.22 Both ended up leaving the lab. Vale’s departure in December 1977 was particularly remarkable since he and several other trainees left and set up a new lab just a few hundred yards away in the same institute!The true price of the Nobel Prize is best expressed in the words of the researchers who actually accomplished the work. As Vale put it:[Guillemin] has given too much control to the people who are giving him the prizes … I think he has always had difficulty in working with people as equals. I care for him, but several of us have learned what hell it can sometimes be for people who get caught up in the meat-grinder, churning out more and more gloire for Guillemin, especially if you are the meat.Whither the Nobel?Guillemin and Schally took competition to pathological levels in the race for the Nobel. Their desire for fame pushed them to do nearly everything (short of outright sabotage) to hinder the progress of their perceived enemies, and in the process, they even drove away their own allies. Their comportment was unacceptable even in light of their genius.However, the blame does not fall entirely on them. The terms of their race were set by the academic system in which they operated: the first to characterize a hormone would receive prestige and awards, while any runners-up would be largely ignored. Furthermore, this prestige would accrue to the lab chief, even if he had not been responsible for the critical contributions. Thus, Schally could not bear to work for Guillemin, because if he made a discovery while in Guillemin’s lab, the credit would go to Guillemin. The fact that the Nobel Prize is only awarded to a maximum of three people means that worthy researchers are inevitably passed over and the prize inevitably “distorts and simplifies the true pattern of achievement.” To win, one must not only be good, but better than everyone else. (Or at least, live longer than them.)If this weren’t dispiriting enough, after receiving a Nobel Prize, a researcher’s productivity often drops. This effect was noted as far back as 1967 and is also mentioned in The Nobel Duel. A recent analysis compared citations to papers published by Nobel laureates in the 3-year period prior to the award, and the 3-year period after the award, and found the post-award papers to be significantly less cited on average. Although this might be explained by regression to the mean,23 in many cases, researchers who win Nobels feel like they can only work on “big problems.” In the field of biology, one example is Jack Szostak, who pivoted his laboratory to studying the origin of life after winning a Nobel.24 It’s a very interesting problem, and his lab has made some progress, but I don’t think they are close to solving it.25 In other cases, researchers begin spreading fringe or discredited ideas after winning a Nobel — Kary Mullis and Luc Montagnier being the best-known examples.26The toxic effects of the Nobel prizes could lead one to conclude that scientific prizes should be abolished altogether. But this conclusion is too simplistic. In science, competition is just like stress hormones: although harmful in excess, moderate levels prove beneficial. Competition encourages researchers to perform to their fullest ability and helps allocate resources to people and projects who can make more impactful contributions.What, then, would a better system look like?One example of a scientific prize done right is the Vesuvius Grand Challenge, which aimed to decipher text on burnt papyrus scrolls from ancient Rome. Instead of rewarding scientists for work that was important in retrospect, the Challenge set a series of clearly defined goals. Furthermore, the prizes were not awarded on a “winner-take-all” basis, which encouraged researcher collaboration. After all, for challenging scientific problems, the default case is that nobody solves them, so it makes sense for researchers to collaborate to increase the chances that the prize will be awarded.To promote scientific progress, a small change in the granting of Nobel Prizes would make a big difference. Instead of focusing the awards on particular people, they should be given for particular discoveries, and each prize should be shared among everyone who made a meaningful contribution to that discovery. This includes lab chiefs, but also the researchers who actually carry out the work. Today, few people remember the names of Matsuo and Burgus, but without them, there would have been no Nobel for Schally and Guillemin. Although it may be difficult to set the threshold for “meaningful contribution,” this would certainly be better than the current system.This call for reform may be wishful thinking. After all, Alfred Nobel’s will specified that prizes should be granted:to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind … one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations.But already, the Nobel committees have expanded the number of laureates per prize from one to three, and waived the requirement that their discoveries were made “during the preceding year.” And the newest Nobel, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was first awarded in 1969. It is not too far-fetched to believe that the Nobel prizes could be reformed again. At the very least, a “Nobel Memorial Prize” could be established for other fields, including biology and computer science.27Looking AheadAfter the Nobel, both Schally and Guillemin continued their work on peptide hormones. Guillemin studied endorphins, and Schally explored potential applications of peptide hormone inhibitors in cancer treatment.28 But in an ironic twist, neither of them identified the structure of CRF, the hormone which both had initially set out to solve. In 1981, shortly after the publication of The Nobel Duel, Wylie Vale published the structure of CRF, a 41-amino-acid peptide, in the journal Science. As for GRF, the peptide that eluded Schally does in fact exist, and its structure was discovered independently by Vale’s lab and Guillemin’s lab, both in 1982.29 Both Schally and Guillemin continued working into old age. Guillemin died in February 2024 at age 100, outliving his former student, Wylie Vale, by 12 years. Schally lasted a few months longer, dying in October 2024 at age 97.30In the years since The Nobel Duel was published, modern methods of molecular biology and proteomics have completely overtaken the traditional biochemical methods of hormone isolation and structure determination.31 And neither Guillemin nor Schally developed any of those traditional methods, instead using techniques that others (including Yalow) created. It’s safe to say that if Schally and Guillemin had not done any of their work, the structures of all the hormones they studied would have been discovered by 1990 at the very latest.32 Perhaps the development of drugs such as GnRH agonists would have been delayed by a decade or so, but overall, I think scientific progress depended more on the development of general methods rather than the knowledge of a few peptide structures.Setting aside the history of the hypothalamus, The Nobel Duel is a cautionary tale about the interplay between the personal ambitions of researchers and the scientific system which awards prestige on a winner-takes-all basis. In the years since its publication, competition within science has only increased,33 largely due to a growing number of researchers competing for a stagnant supply of grant money, as well as the pressures of patents and commercial licensing. With recent Nobel controversies (such as the 2024 Physics prize going to AI researchers, or the 2020 Chemistry prize omitting several worthy CRISPR researchers), the time is ripe for reform. Let’s hope that in the future, scientific success will be defined as lifting humanity up rather than pushing one’s colleagues down.This article is accompanied by an Interview with the author.

DOI: 10.62211/32pt-67hjLead image by Ella Watkins-Dulaney.Further Reading:Contemporary reviews of The Nobel Duel in JAMA (which thought it was “meticulously researched and brilliantly presented”), in NEJM (which praised the coverage of the science, but concluded that the author had gone too far in criticizing the duelists) and in the New York Times (which called it a “compelling account”).The Heart of the Brain (reviewed here) is a guide to the hypothalamus, and aimed at a popular audience.Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Scientific Facts is a sociological study of the Guillemin lab conducted in 1979. I must point out that the sociological conclusions drawn by its authors are much less generalizable to other labs than the authors believed!A Conversation with Roger Guillemin (Annual Review of Physiology, 2013)Obituary of Roger GuilleminObituary of Andrew Schally1There are also prizes for Peace and Literature, as well as a “Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.” Each prize can be shared by at most three people.2One-half of the prize was awarded to Rosalyn Yalow, a biochemist who developed ways to quantify peptide hormones using radioactive labeling. Yalow was the second-ever female laureate for the Physiology or Medicine prize; the first was Gerty Cori, who won jointly with her husband in 1947.3Notably, the size and morphology differs between males and females. This reflects the hypothalamus’ role in regulating sex hormones.4Marshall and Verney, 1936; Harris, 19375Nerves connect to the posterior pituitary, which produces vasopressin and oxytocin. The anterior pituitary, which produces all the other pituitary hormones, lacks a direct nervous connection.6Selye’s approach was “essentially intuitive, based on observation and vast screening programs” to study stress response in rats, but Guillemin and Fortier both favored a deductive, rather than inductive, approach to research. Fortier kept the conflict mostly under control, and additionally saved Guillemin’s life by developing a new treatment when Guillemin fell ill with tubercular meningitis.7Now Vilnius, Lithuania, after Stalin changed the borders.8According to The Nobel Duel, “the invention of the accepted name for the hypothalamic hormones was a matter of such significance to Guillemin and Schally that they were still quarreling over it twenty-four years later.” Guillemin had proposed “hypothalamic hypophysiotrophic principles,” but Saffran’s “releasing factor” name caught on, probably because it was easier to say. For a similar nomenclature battle, see Anti-Mullerian Hormone vs. Mullerian-Inhibiting Substance (two names for the same reproductive hormone – AMH has largely but not completely won out).9Interestingly, Sephadex chromatography was mentioned in The Nobel Duel as an exciting new technique that Andrew Schally learned from a visit to Sweden in 1961. Schally and Guillemin withheld publication of their results using Sephadex to purify CRF in order to retain an advantage over competitors.10Guillemin described the process in an interview in 2013:\tInterviewer: Many young people will not realize you had to do these experiments in animals.Guillemin: Absolutely. A bioassay can give you a result usually in two days, when it’s very good. Some people used bioassays that would take a month to give a response. The only way we could look for this CRF was by studying the secretion of ACTH, which itself was ascertained by looking at the amount of ascorbic acid in an extract of the adrenal gland of hypophysectomized rats [i.e., rats where the pituitary had been surgically removed]. [It was] expensive because you had to buy hundreds of these hypophysectomized rats, which, by the way, you could buy as such. I knew how to do it, but when you need about 100 for a data point, it was easier to buy them as such.The most revolutionary method came a few years later, when Sol [Solomon] Berson and Rosalyn Yalow published their first result with what they called radioimmunoassays, which were actually an incredibly simple method. On top of that, they were thousands of times more sensitive than our bioassays.11Primarily because they can be easily removed from the skull. Other species, such as pigs, have a bone structure less suitable for dissection.12Guillemin’s TRF assay was an adaptation of a previously developed assay for TSH, which measured radioactive iodine in thyroid hormones.13Peptides are entirely made up of amino acids. Other non-peptide biomolecules (for example phosphatidylserine) can still contain amino acids, but at lower fractions. At the time, Schally wrote: “Purified material [TRF] appears to be not a simple polypeptide since amino acids account for only 30% of its composition”. This turned out to be incorrect.14This flaw in Guillemin’s character was not limited to Schally. As discussed in other parts of this review, Guillemin drove away several of his own biochemists by refusing to sufficiently credit their contributions.15This is illustrated by an exchange in which Guillemin requested a copy of some data which Schally had presented at a conference (and was thus obligated to provide, according to the conference rules). At first, Schally refused. Next, Guillemin sent another letter, appealing to Schally’s sense of honor as a scientist and asking for his cooperation. Schally replied that if “researchers choose to cooperate in a non-gentlemanly fashion (even though duels and wars in the past have been carried out according to a certain code of ethics), very often I have no choice but to use identical tactics myself.” After a third letter from Guillemin, Schally finally provided the data.16The junior researchers were generally less sanguine about the rivalry, and more interested in “getting the science done without acrimony.”17Franz Enzmann had noticed traces of a fatty acid in Schally’s sample of TRF. This turned out to be a contaminant, but the idea led Schally down the right path.18LRF is today known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) because it regulates the release of both LH and FSH (gonadotropin hormones) from the pituitary.19And not only for Guillemin, but for all the other researchers who had invested their efforts into determining the structure of LRF. The Nobel Duel mentions Harris as well as two other researchers, McCann and Fawcett, who fell short due to not having access to massive quantities of brains.20Which would win in 1978, a year after Schally and Guillemin.21Yalow co-developed her assay with Solomon Berson, who died in 1972 and was thus ineligible for the Nobel Prize.22Nicholas Wade interviewed Vale while reporting for the book, and wrote that Guillemin had “hinted plainly in several private discussions [with Vale] that Vale was expected to lead an attack on Burgus, and moreover, that this was a test of loyalty, for which failure would mean Vale’s expulsion from grace. Vale was not about to turn on his colleague Burgus. In what he said he essentially criticized Guillemin instead, knowing that in doing so he had crossed the Rubicon.”23I don’t think it’s entirely regression to the mean, though, because typically Nobels are given for work performed 10-20 years before the award, not 0-3 years before the award.24Szostak began his origin-of-life work several years before he won the Nobel Prize, in 2009. After the Prize, however, his lab has pretty much exclusively focused on it.25This is based on my experience working in the Szostak lab for a month as a rotation student in 2019, as well as following their more recent papers.26The Nobel Peace Prize is even more wacky in this respect: several laureates have gone on to commit atrocities.27This would certainly please chemists and physicists, who see Nobels in Chemistry and Physics being snatched up by biologists and AI researchers.28This has not led to any approved treatments, as far as I know.29The discovery was enabled through use of a pancreatic cancer cell line that produced large amounts of GRF (also known as GHRH). Guillemin describes more about how he got the tumor sample in his 2013 interview.30I started writing this review in 2022, after hearing about the book from Stephen Hammes at the Frontiers in Reproduction course. At the time, both Schally and Guillemin were still alive. As the saying goes, book review longa, vita brevis.31As Guillemin himself reflected in a 2013 interview:I never made the jump [to molecular biology] because I was intellectually too lazy to do it. Somebody like Wylie Vale did make the jump, and later on in his career, it became quite important. There’s no doubt in my mind that the type of biology that I did in those days, with all those years of effort, those tons of brain tissue, those millions of sheep brain — any postdoc or graduate student nowadays can do better than that with one pituitary hormone or one hypothalamus, based on the new technology of molecular biology. It’s a totally different world.32Structures of complex hormones such as basic FGF were already being discovered by the end of the 1980s.33Recent examples of competition I’m familiar with include: the development of synthetic embryo models (labs of Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz, Jacob Hanna, and others), split-pool single cell sequencing methods (labs of Jay Shendure and. Georg Seelig), bacterial genomic recoding (labs of Jason Chin and George Church), and genome editing tools (too many labs to count, really). Of course, scientific competition isn’t new (just look at Newton vs. Leibniz) but increased pressure leads to more of it.Subscribe to Asimov PressScience and technology for a flourishing future.

      "en": "**Summary of \"The Nobel Duel\"**\n\n\"The Nobel Duel\" by Nicholas Wade narrates the intense rivalry between two endocrinologists, Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin, who both contributed to discovering peptide hormones from the hypothalamus, earning them the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The book highlights how the competitive nature of scientific research can shape careers and scientific progress.\n\n1. **The Importance of the Nobel Prize**: The Nobel Prize is a prestigious award that many scientists aspire to win, often leading to intense competition among researchers.\n\n2. **The Discovery Process**: Schally and Guillemin's work focused on the hypothalamus, a brain region critical for hormonal regulation. Their discoveries were fueled by a desire for recognition, leading to a bitter rivalry as they raced to isolate hormones crucial for understanding bodily functions.\n\n3. **Conflict and Competition**: Their competition turned personal, marked by undermining each other’s work and public disputes. This rivalry impacted their collaborations and ultimately strained their relationships with colleagues.\n\n4. **Challenges in Research**: Both faced significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the hormones due to the small quantities produced by the hypothalamus and the limitations of the analytical methods available at the time.\n\n5. **Scientific Breakthroughs**: Despite their conflicts, both scientists made significant contributions that advanced the understanding of hormonal function. They eventually succeeded in determining the structures of several hormones, leading to their joint Nobel recognition.\n\n6. **Aftermath of the Nobel**: Winning the Nobel Prize did not eliminate the rivalry or the pressures they faced. Both experienced setbacks in their careers post-award, often due to the toxic competitive environment they fostered.\n\n7. **Call for Reform**: The book suggests that the current system of awarding scientific prizes, particularly the Nobel, encourages harmful competition. It proposes a model that recognizes collective contributions rather than focusing solely on individual achievements.\n\nOverall, \"The Nobel Duel\" serves as a cautionary tale about the dark side of ambition in science, illustrating how the pursuit of accolades can distort relationships and hinder collaboration.",

I was pretty young when I earned my PhD, so I’ve been a professor for a long time—over 30 years. If you’re not in academia, or it’s been awhile since you were in college, you might not know this: the students are not what they used to be. The problem with even talking about this topic at all is the knee-jerk response of, “yeah, just another old man complaining about the kids today, the same way everyone has since Gilgamesh. Shake your fist at the clouds, dude.”1 So yes, I’m ready to hear that. Go right ahead. Because people need to know. First, some context. I teach at a regional public university in the US. Our students are  average on just about any dimension you care to name—aspirations, intellect, socio-economic status, physical fitness. They wear hoodies and yoga pants and like Buffalo wings. They listen to Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift. That’s in no way a put-down: I firmly believe that the average citizen deserves a shot at a good education and even more importantly a shot at a good life. All I mean is that our students are representative; they’re neither the bottom of the academic barrel nor the cream off the top. As with every college we get a range of students, and our best philosophy majors have gone on to earn PhDs or go to law school. We’re also an NCAA Division 2 school and I watched one of our graduates become an All-Pro lineman for the Saints. These are exceptions, and what I say here does not apply to every single student. But what I’m about to describe are the average students at Average State U.Scriptorium Philosophia is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.SubscribeReadingMost of our students are functionally illiterate. This is not a joke. By “functionally illiterate” I mean “unable to read and comprehend adult novels by people like Barbara Kingsolver, Colson Whitehead, and Richard Powers.” I picked those three authors because they are all recent Pulitzer Prize winners, an objective standard of “serious adult novel.” Furthermore, I’ve read them all and can testify that they are brilliant, captivating writers; we’re not talking about Finnegans Wake here. But at the same time they aren’t YA, romantasy, or Harry Potter either. I’m not saying our students just prefer genre books or graphic novels or whatever. No, our average graduate literally could not read a serious adult novel cover-to-cover and understand what they read. They just couldn’t do it. They don’t have the desire to try, the vocabulary to grasp what they read,2 and most certainly not the attention span to finish. For them to sit down and try to read a book like The Overstory might as well be me attempting an Iron Man triathlon: much suffering with zero chance of success. Students are not absolutely illiterate in the sense of being unable to sound out any words whatsoever. Reading bores them, though. They are impatient to get through whatever burden of reading they have to, and move their eyes over the words just to get it done. They’re like me clicking through a mandatory online HR training. Students get exam questions wrong simply because they didn't even take the time to read the question properly. Reading anything more than a menu is a chore and to be avoided.The Buffalo wings look goodThey also lie about it. I wrote the textbook for a course I regularly teach. It’s a fairly popular textbook, so I’m assuming it is not terribly written. I did everything I could to make the writing lively and packed with my most engaging examples. The majority of students don’t read it. Oh, they will come to my office hours (occasionally) because they are bombing the course, and tell me that they have been doing the reading, but it’s obvious they are lying. The most charitable interpretation is that they looked at some of the words, didn’t understand anything, pretended that counted as reading, and returned to looking at TikTok. This study says that 65% of college students reported that they skipped buying or renting a textbook because of cost. I believe they didn’t buy the books, but I’m skeptical that cost is the true reason, as opposed to just the excuse they offer. Yes, I know some texts, especially in the sciences, are expensive. However, the books I assign are low-priced. All texts combined for one of my courses is between $35-$100 and they still don’t buy them. Why buy what you aren’t going to read anyway? Just google it. Even in upper-division courses that students supposedly take out of genuine interest they won’t read. I’m teaching Existentialism this semester. It is entirely primary texts—Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre. The reading ranges from accessible but challenging to extremely difficult but we’re making a go of it anyway (looking at you, Being and Nothingness). This is a close textual analysis course. My students come to class without the books, which they probably do not own and definitely did not read. WritingTheir writing skills are at the 8th-grade level. Spelling is atrocious, grammar is random, and the correct use of apostrophes is cause for celebration. Worse is the resistance to original thought. What I mean is the reflexive submission of the cheapest cliché as novel insight. Exam question: Describe the attitude of Dostoevsky’s Underground Man towards acting in one’s own self-interest, and how this is connected to his concerns about free will. Are his views self-contradictory?Student: With the UGM its all about our journey in life, not the destination. He beleives we need to take time to enjoy the little things becuase life is short and you never gonna know what happens. Sometimes he contradicts himself cause sometimes you say one thing but then you think something else later. It’s all relative.You probably think that’s satire. Either that, or it looks like this:Exam question: Describe the attitude of Dostoevsky’s Underground Man towards acting in one’s own self-interest, and how this is connected to his concerns about free will. Are his views self-contradictory?Student: Dostoevsky’s Underground Man paradoxically rejects the idea that people always act in their own self-interest, arguing instead that humans often behave irrationally to assert their free will. He criticizes rationalist philosophies like utilitarianism, which he sees as reducing individuals to predictable mechanisms, and insists that people may choose suffering just to prove their autonomy. However, his stance is self-contradictory—while he champions free will, he is paralyzed by inaction and self-loathing, trapped in a cycle of bitterness. Through this, Dostoevsky explores the tension between reason, free will, and self-interest, exposing the complexities of human motivation.That’s right, ChatGPT. The students cheat. I’ve written about cheating in “Why AI is Destroying Academic Integrity,” so I won’t repeat it here, but the cheating tsunami has definitely changed what assignments I give. I can’t assign papers any more because I’ll just get AI back, and there’s nothing I can do to make it stop. Sadly, not writing exacerbates their illiteracy; writing is a muscle and dedicated writing is a workout for the mind as well as the pen.ArithmeticI’m less informed to speak out on this one, but my math prof friends tell me that their students are increasingly less capable and less willing to put in the effort. As a result they have had to make their tests easier with fewer hard problems. When I was a first semester freshman (at a private SLAC, yes, but it wasn’t CalTech) I took Calculus 1. Second semester I took Calculus 2. I don’t think pre-calculus was even a thing back then. Now apparently pre-calc counts as an advanced content course. My psych prof friends who teach statistics have similarly lamented having to water down the content over time.Symbolic Logic was a requirement when I was a grad student. The course was a cross-listed upper-division undergrad/grad class. Jaegwon Kim taught the course, and our sole textbook was W. V. Quine’s Methods of Logic, which we worked through in its entirety. I think we spent two weeks on propositional logic before moving on to the predicate calculus. We proved compactness, soundness, and completeness, and probably some other theorems I forget. There is no possible way our students, unless they were math or computer science majors, would survive that class.What’s changed?The average student has seen college as basically transactional for as long as I’ve been doing this. They go through the motions and maybe learn something along the way, but it is all in service to the only conception of the good life they can imagine: a job with middle-class wages. I’ve mostly made my peace with that, do my best to give them a taste of the life of the mind, and celebrate the successes.Things have changed. Ted Gioia describes modern students as checked-out, phone-addicted zombies. Troy Jollimore writes, “I once believed my students and I were in this together, engaged in a shared intellectual pursuit. That faith has been obliterated over the past few semesters.” Faculty have seen a stunning level of disconnection. SubscribeWhat has changed exactly? Chronic absenteeism. As a friend in Sociology put it, “Attendance is a HUGE problem—many just treat class as optional.” Last semester across all sections, my average student missed two weeks of class. Actually it was more than that, since I’m not counting excused absences or students who eventually withdrew. A friend in Mathematics told me, “Students are less respectful of the university experience —attendance, lateness, e-mails to me about nonsense, less sense of responsibility.” Disappearing students. Students routinely just vanish at some point during the semester. They don’t officially drop or withdraw from the course, they simply quit coming. No email, no notification to anyone in authority about some problem. They just pull an Amelia Earhart. It’s gotten to the point that on the first day of class, especially in lower-division, I tell the students, “look to your right. Now look to your left. One of you will be gone by the end of the semester. Don’t let it be you.”They can’t sit in a seat for 50 minutes. Students routinely get up during a 50 minute class, sometimes just 15 minutes in, and leave the classroom. I’m supposed to believe that they suddenly, urgently need the toilet, but the reality is that they are going to look at their phones. They know I’ll call them out on it in class, so instead they walk out. I’ve even told them to plan ahead and pee before class, like you tell a small child before a road trip, but it has no effect. They can’t make it an hour without getting their phone fix.They want me to do their work for them. During the Covid lockdown, faculty bent over backwards in every way we knew how to accommodate students during an unprecedented (in our lifetimes) health crisis. Now students expect that as a matter of routine. I am frequently asked for my PowerPoint slides, which basically function for me as lecture notes. It is unimaginable to me that I would have ever asked one of my professors for their own lecture notes. No, you can’t have my slides. Get the notes from a classmate. Read the book. Come to office hours for a conversation if you are still confused after the preceding steps. Last week I had an email from a student who essentially asked me to recap an entire week’s worth of lecture material for him prior to yesterday’s midterm. No, I’m not doing that. I’m not writing you a 3000-word email. Try coming to class.Pretending to type notes in their laptops. I hate laptops in class, but if I try to ban them the students will just run to Accommodative Services and get them to tell me that the student must use a laptop or they will explode into tiny pieces. But I know for a fact that note-taking is at best a small part of what they are doing. Last semester I had a good student tell me, “hey you know that kid who sits in front of me with the laptop? Yeah, I thought you should know that all he does in class is gamble on his computer.” Gambling, looking at the socials, whatever, they are not listening to me or participating in discussion. They are staring at a screen.Indifference. Like everyone else, I allow students to make up missed work if they have an excused absence. No, you can’t make up the midterm because you were  hungover and slept through your alarm, but you can if you had Covid. Then they just don’t show up. A missed quiz from a month ago might as well have happened in the Stone Age; students can’t be bothered to make it up or even talk to me about it because they just don’t care.It’s the phones, stupid. They are absolutely addicted to their phones. When I go work out at the Campus Rec Center, easily half of the students there are just sitting on the machines scrolling on their phones. I was talking with a retired faculty member at the Rec this morning who works out all the time. He said he has done six sets waiting for a student to put down their phone and get off the machine he wanted. The students can’t get off their phones for an hour to do a voluntary activity they chose for fun. Sometimes I’m amazed they ever leave their goon caves at all.I don’t blame K-12 teachers. This is not an educational system problem, this is a societal problem. What am I supposed to do? Keep standards high and fail them all? That’s not an option for untenured faculty who would like to keep their jobs. I’m a tenured full professor. I could probably get away with that for a while, but sooner or later the Dean’s going to bring me in for a sit-down. Plus, if we flunk out half the student body and drive the university into bankruptcy, all we’re doing is depriving the good students of an education. We’re told to meet the students where they are, flip the classroom, use multimedia, just be more entertaining, get better. As if rearranging the deck chairs just the right way will stop the Titanic from going down. As if it is somehow the fault of the faculty. It’s not our fault. We’re doing the best we can with what we’ve been given.All this might sound like an angry rant. I’m not sure. I’m not angry, though, not at all. I’m just sad. One thing all faculty have to learn is that the students are not us. We can’t expect them all to burn with the sacred fire we have for our disciplines, to see philosophy, psychology, math, physics, sociology or economics as the divine light of reason in a world of shadow. Our job is to kindle that flame, and we’re trying to get that spark to catch, but it is getting harder and harder and we don’t know what to do.Thanks for reading Scriptorium Philosophia!

They teach at a regional public university and describe students as typical in various aspects, including interests and backgrounds. However, they express concern that many students are functionally illiterate, unable to read and comprehend serious adult literature. \n\nStudents often do not read assigned texts, relying on excuses like cost, but the author believes the real reason is a lack of desire and effort. Writing skills are also declining, with many students producing work at an 8th-grade level and resorting to clichés instead of original thought. Cheating has become prevalent, making traditional assignments difficult to assess. \n\nAttendance is another issue, with students frequently missing classes and often leaving mid-session. Many exhibit a lack of responsibility, expecting professors to provide notes and recap lectures. The author attributes these challenges largely to students' addiction to their phones and a general indifference towards education. \n\nDespite these frustrations, the author remains committed to their teaching but feels increasingly challenged in engaging students.

    "content": "Compress Better, Compute BiggerMarch 4, 2025 · 9 min readFrancesc AltedCEO ironArray SLUHave you ever experienced the frustration of not being able to analyze a dataset because it's too large to fit in memory? Or perhaps you've encountered the memory wall, where computation is hindered by slow memory access? These are common challenges in data science and high-performance computing. The developers of Blosc and Blosc2 have consistently focused on achieving compression and decompression speeds that approach or even exceed memory bandwidth limits.\nMoreover, with the introduction of a new compute engine in Blosc2 3.0, the guiding principle has evolved to \"Compress Better, Compute Bigger.\" This enhancement enables computations on datasets that are over 100 times larger than the available RAM, all while maintaining high performance. Continue reading to know how to operate with datasets of 8 TB in human timeframes, using your own hardware.\nThe Importance of Better Compression\nData compression typically requires a trade-off between speed and compression ratio. Blosc2 allows users to fine-tune this balance. They can select from a variety of codecs and filters to maximize compression, and even introduce custom ones via its plugin system. For optimal speed, it's crucial to understand and utilize modern CPU capabilities. Multicore processing, SIMD, and cache hierarchies can significantly boost compression performance. Blosc2 leverages these features to achieve speeds close to memory bandwidth limits, and sometimes even surpassing them, particularly with contemporary CPUs.\nHowever, improved compression is only part of the solution. Rapid partial decompression is crucial when quick access to large datasets is needed. Blosc2 features n-dimensional containers that support flexible slicing, essential for non-linear data access. Leveraging two-level partitioning, Blosc2 delivers high-speed data access. Think of Blosc2 as a compressed-data version of \"NumPy\". Furthermore, data can reside in memory, on disk, or across a network.\nA significant challenge is leveraging compression to overcome the memory wall, which hinders computation in many scenarios. The memory wall arises when the CPU waits for data from memory, a slow process relative to CPU speed. Addressing this requires tightly integrating compression and computation, utilizing all available hardware resources.\nComputing with Blosc2\nThe integrated compute engine in Blosc2 3.x enables the calculation of complex expressions on datasets much larger than available memory. By leveraging CPU caches, Blosc2 temporarily stores there decompressed data chunks from compressed containers, allowing the CPU to operate on cached data, minimizing memory access.\nTo illustrate this, we'll use a reduction calculation as a simple example. Reductions are frequently used in data science to create informative summaries of large datasets. Here, we will reduce the result of a complex expression that involves large, n-dimensional datasets.\nHere it is the core Python code that we will use:\nimport numpy as npimport blosc2N = 1000_000  # this will varydtype = np.float64a = blosc2.linspace(0, 1, N * N, dtype=dtype, shape=(N, N))b = blosc2.linspace(1, 2, N * N, dtype=dtype, shape=(N, N))c = blosc2.linspace(0, 1, N, dtype=dtype, shape=(N,))  # 1D array; broadcasting is supportedout = np.sum(((a ** 3 + np.sin(a * 2)) < c) & (b > 0), axis=1)\nThe blosc2.linspace function generates a dataset of a specified shape, populated with a linearly spaced sequence. We utilize it to initialize the a, b, and c operands. Subsequently, we compute the reduction of the expression ((a ** 3 + np.sin(a * 2)) < c) & (b > 0) along the first axis, assigning the result to the out variable. This expression leverages NumPy functions on Blosc2 arrays because Blosc2 NDArrays override NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs), substituting them with optimized Blosc2 counterparts for enhanced performance. Additionally, standard NumPy broadcasting is supported, enabling the comparison of a 1D array c with a 2D array a.\nThe experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor, running Ubuntu Linux 24.10 and featuring 64 GB of RAM, along with a high-speed SSD (up to 7 GB/s for sequential reads). The software stack included Python 3.13.1, Python-Blosc2 3.2.0, Numexpr 2.10.2, NumPy 2.2.3, Zarr 3.0.4, Dask 2025.2.0 and Numba 0.61.0.\nCompression vs. No Compression\nTo begin, let's evaluate Blosc2's performance with and without compression. We measured the computation time for the reduction across varying working set sizes. The results are visualized in the following plot:\n\nBlosc2 significantly outperforms NumPy in this case for both in-memory and on-disk datasets, achieving speeds more than 10x faster. This is primarily because: 1) Blosc2 utilizes Numexpr internally when feasible, reverting to NumPy only when Numexpr cannot handle the operation (such as the reduction step), and 2) Blosc2 stores intermediate results in CPU caches, minimizing memory access. Furthermore, using fast compression (LZ4+shuffle) yields the best performance (surpassing even uncompressed scenarios) as the time to fetch and decompress data is less than fetching uncompressed data directly from memory.\nIt's also noteworthy that Blosc2 maintains its performance for significantly larger working set sizes compared to NumPy. The plot illustrates that Blosc2 can compute the expression for working sets up to 180 GB without a performance decrease when compression is enabled. Without compression, Blosc2 scales effectively up to 55 GB before experiencing performance degradation. In contrast, NumPy's performance starts to decline at 30 GB. This disparity arises because NumPy utilizes temporary arrays to store intermediate results, whereas Blosc2 employs smaller temporaries that fit within CPU caches, thereby minimizing memory accesses.\nBlosc2 vs. Other Solutions\nWe compared Blosc2 with other data containers and compute engines, including Zarr (a data container that can use Blosc compression), Dask (a parallel computing library for NumPy), and Numba (a just-in-time compiler for NumPy expressions). Numba, which requires NumPy containers and lacks native compression or on-disk data support, was included for reference. This evaluation focuses on in-memory datasets, and the results are presented below.\n\nIn this scenario, Zarr's compression (via Blosc+LZ4) enhances Dask's performance, maintaining it even when the working set size exceeds available RAM due to Dask's blocked computation algorithms. However, Blosc2 computes the expression significantly faster than Zarr+Dask, both with and without compression (LZ4 in this case). This advantage stems from Blosc2's tight integration of compression and computation, which minimizes buffer copies and memory accesses. It's worth noting that uncompressed Blosc2's performance decreases to Zarr+Dask levels when the working set size surpasses available RAM, while compressed Blosc2 continues to perform well with larger working set sizes.\nOn the other hand, Numba computes the expression faster than NumPy and Zarr+Dask but doesn't scale well for larger working set sizes. Its performance significantly decreases below Zarr+Dask levels when exceeding available RAM. The reason for Numba's poor scaling with larger working set sizes is unclear, although it may require rewriting the expression with explicit loops for optimal performance, which falls outside the scope of this experiment.\nCompute Bigger (Beyond RAM)\nA valid question is whether Blosc2's scalability with compression can continue indefinitely. The answer is no; RAM has a finite capacity. Once the compressed working set size exceeds the available RAM, performance will inevitably decrease. To investigate this, we conducted the same experiment, but with extended working set sizes up to 8 TB. The results are shown below:\n\nWe focused our extended size range tests on LZ4 and ZSTD codecs due to the substantial working sizes involved, which would have resulted in prohibitively long run times for non-compression scenarios. With LZ4, Blosc2 maintains high-performance reduction computations for in-memory datasets up to 1 TB and on-disk datasets up to 600 GB. Beyond these thresholds, performance decreases moderately; however, on-disk datasets exhibit superior scaling compared to in-memory datasets, achieving faster speeds for working set sizes exceeding 1 TB.\nWith ZSTD, performance degradation occurs later (around 2.5 TB) due to its superior compression ratios compared to LZ4 (approximately 2.5x better in this scenario). Beyond 3 TB, on-disk performance surpasses in-memory performance, mirroring the behavior observed with LZ4 but at larger working set sizes.\nSo, in general, but also in terms of performance, on-disk datasets are preferable for very large working set sizes due to their superior scaling compared to in-memory datasets. Even for medium-sized datasets, the performance of on-disk storage closely matches that of in-memory. Additionally, storing datasets on disk offers the convenience of persistent storage and reusability.\nReproducing the Experiments: The code used in these experiments is available in the Blosc2 repository. To replicate the results, ensure you have Blosc2, Numexpr, NumPy, Zarr, Dask, and Numba installed. A machine with at least 32 GB of RAM (64 GB recommended), a 1.5 TB swap area, and 600 GB of free disk space is also required. For optimal performance, a CPU with a large cache (32 MB or more) is recommended.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Blosc2 achieves superior compression and enables computation on larger datasets by tightly integrating compression and computation, interleaving I/O and computation, and utilizing great libraries like Numexpr and NumPy. This allows Blosc2 to handle significantly larger working sets than other solutions, delivering high performance for both in-memory and on-disk datasets, even exceeding available RAM (up to 8 TB in our tests, but you can go as far as your disk allows).\nIronArray proudly supports Blosc2's development, recognizing its pivotal role in our data processing tools. We eagerly anticipate upcoming features and the continued evolution of Blosc2.\nAppendix (2025-04-28)\nThe array interface protocol has been implemented for all Blosc2 array containers in Python-Blosc2 3.2.1. This enhancement allows direct use of most NumPy functions with native Blosc2 containers, creating a familiar experience for NumPy users. This integration enables you to benefit from Blosc2's powerful compression and decompression capabilities, while still leveraging NumPy's comprehensive function library.\nOn the other hand, this allows Blosc2 containers to be seamlessly used with Pandas, Numba, Dask, CuPy and others.\nFor a practical demonstration, examine the performance comparison between Blosc2, NumPy, and Numba when performing in-memory computation with the NumPy cumsum() function. This function hasn't yet been specifically optimized in either Blosc2 or Numba, but as the c array is relatively small, this should not hinder performance too much. The benchmark uses a 32 GB working set (uncompressed), which fits within the available 64 GB RAM of our test system:\n\nFor reproducibility, see benchmark sources.Tags:compressioncomputationmemorydiskspeed",

    "content": "cURL and libcurl\n\n\t\t\tHTTPS RR in curl\n\n\t\t\tMarch 31, 2025 Daniel Stenberg\t\t\tLeave a comment\n\nRFC 9460 describes a DNS Resource Record (RR) named HTTPS. To highlight that it is exactly this DNS record called HTTPS we speak of, we try to always call it HTTPS RR using both words next to each other.\n\ncurl currently offers experimental support for HTTPS RR in git. Experimental means you need to enable it explicitly in the build to have it present.\n\ncmake -DUSE_HTTPSRR=ON ...\n\nor\n\nconfigure --enable-httpsrr ...\n\nWhat is HTTPS RR for?\n\nIt is a DNS field that provides service meta-data about a target hostname. In many ways this is an alternative record to SRV and URI that were never really used for the web and HTTP. It also kind of supersedes the HSTS and alt-svc headers.\n\nHere is some data it offers:\n\nECH config\n\nECH is short for Encrypted Client Hello and is the established system for encrypting the SNI field in TLS handshakes. As you may recall, the SNI field is one of the last remaining pieces in a HTTPS connection that is sent in the clear and thus reveals to active listeners with which site the client intends to communicate. ECH hides this by encrypting the name.\n\nFor ECH to be able to work, the client needs information prior to actually doing the handshake and this field is provides this data. curl features experimental ECH support.\n\nECH has been in the works for several years, but has still not been published in an RFC.\n\nALPN list\n\nA list of ALPN identifiers is provided. These identifiers basically tell the client which HTTP versions this server wants to use (over HTTPS). If this list contains HTTP/1.1 and we were asked to do a HTTP:// transfer, it implies the client should upgrade to HTTPS. Thus sort of replacing HSTS.\n\nI think the key ALPN id provided here is ‘h3’ which tells the client this server supports HTTP/3 and we can try that already in the first flight. The previous option to properly upgrade to HTTP/3 would be to wait for a alt-svc response header that could instruct a subsequent connect attempt. That then delays the upgrade significantly since reusing the by then already existing HTTP/2 or HTTP/1 connection is typically preferred by clients.\n\nTarget\n\nThe service is offered on another hostname. Alt-svc style. It can also provide information about how to access this site for different “services” so that TCP/TLS connections go one way and QUIC connections another.\n\nPort\n\nIt can tell the client that the service is hosted on a different port number.\n\nIP addresses\n\nIt can provide a list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the name. Supposedly to be used in case there are no A or AAAA fields retrieved at the same time.\n\nGetting the DNS record\n\nAdding support for HTTPS RR into an existing TCP client such as curl is unfortunately not as straight-forward as we would like.\n\nA primary obstacle is that regular hostname resolves are done with the POSIX function getaddrinfo() and this function has no knowledge of or support for HTTPS RR and such support cannot expected to get added in a future either. The API does not really allow that. Clients like curl simply need to get the additional records using other means.\n\nHow curl does it\n\ncurl, or rather libcurl, has three different ways in source code to resolve hostnames out of which most builds feature two options:\n\nDoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) – curl sends DNS requests using HTTPS to a specified server. Users need to explicitly ask for this and point out the DoH URL.\n\nUsing the local resolver. A libcurl build can then use either c-ares or getaddrinfo() to resolve host names, for when DoH or a proxy etc are not used.\n\nDoH\n\nThe DoH code in libcurl is a native implementation (it does not use any third party libraries) and libcurl features code for both sending HTTPS RR requests and parsing the responses.\n\ngetaddrinfo\n\nWhen using this API for name resolving, libcurl still needs to get built with c-ares as well to provide the service of asking for the HTTPS RR. libcurl then resolves the hostname “normally” with getaddrinfo() (fired off in a separate helper thread typically) and asks for the HTTPS RR using c-ares in parallel.\n\nc-ares\n\nWhen c-ares is used for name resolving, it also asks for the HTTPS RR at the same time. It means c-ares asks for A, AAAA and HTTPS records.\n\nExisting shortcomings\n\nWe do not offer a runtime option to disable using HTTPS-RR yet, so if you build with it enabled it will always be attempted. I think we need to provide such an option for the times the HTTPS record is either just plain wrong or the user wants to debug or just play around differently.\n\ncurl also does not yet currently handle every aspect of the quite elaborate HTTPS RR. We have decided to go forward slowly and focus our implementation on the parts of the resource field that seem to be deployed and in actual use.\n\nDeployed\n\nThere are sites using these records already today. Cloudflare seems to provide it for a lot of its hosted sites for example. If you enable HTTPS-RR today, there are plenty of opportunities to try it out. Both for regular service and protocol switching and also for ECH.\n\nPlease, go ahead and enable it in a build, try it out and tell us what works and what does not work. We would love to move forward on this and if we get confirmation from users that it actually works, we might be able transition it out from experimental status soon.\n\n\tcURL and libcurldnsECHHTTPS-RR",

Since 2022, with Android 11, Google removed this access from app developers. Under their new package visibility policy, apps should only see other installed apps if it’s essential to their core functionality. Developers must also explicitly declare these apps in the AndroidManifest.xml file - a required configuration file for all Android apps.For extremely specific use cases such as file managers, browsers or antivirus apps, Google grants an exception by allowing QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission, which provides full visibility into installed apps. I don’t use Android as my primary phone, but I have a spare one and I was really curious to find out which apps from Indian companies had checks to see what other apps I had installed.So I downloaded a few dozen Indian apps I could think of on top of my head and started reading their manifest files. Surely they will be respectful of my privacy and will only query apps essential to their app's core functionality? 🙃SubscribeIt's worth acknowledging that there are some legitimate reasons for an app to check which other apps are installed on your phone. For example, an app might check which UPI apps are installed to show relevant payment options. Most of the manifest files I examined included checks for these apps. Some also looked for app cloning or multi-account apps, likely for security and fraud detection. All acceptable use cases.But a few Indian companies went above and beyond with these checks. Let’s start with Swiggy. It has a staggering 154 package names listed in its manifest file, allowing it to query those apps on my phone. Here’s the full list:I don’t even know where to begin unpacking this madness. How is knowing whether I have the Xbox or the Playstation app installed on my phone essential to their Swiggy's core functionality? How will knowing if I have the Naukri or Upstox app help them deliver groceries to my doorstep?The wide range of categories of apps in this list strongly suggests Swiggy is collecting installed apps data for user profiling and to build a behavioural profile of their customers. This seems to be against Play Store's policies which considers the list of installed apps to be personal and sensitive user data.This reminded me of that ppt from Blume Ventures - the one that blue tick twitter accounts living in certain pin codes of Bengaluru passionately discuss amongst themselves for a week every year. It had this interesting slide on apps used by different Indias:Swiggy queries most of these apps and more on your phone. It not only knows which India you belong to, but it can pinpoint exactly where you fall within it.Let's talk about another app now, and it's the usual suspect, the undisputed champion of asshole design - Zepto. They have listed 165 apps to check for on your device.￼From Netflix to Bumble to Binance, the list includes nearly every popular app across all categories. There were recent reports of Zepto displaying different prices for iOS and Android users. With the help of this data, they can also show different pricing for different Android phones, which some customers are already seeing.Even though Swiggy and Zepto have to declare these apps to query in the manifest file, as a user, you have no visibility into this list when you download their apps from the Play Store.I also analyzed Swiggy and Zepto's apps for their delivery riders. The app query list is different from their consumer apps. Both include checks to see which other companies their riders work for. Here’s Zepto's list:But Swiggy takes it a step further - it also checks for personal loan apps, personal finance apps, and even keeps tabs on apps like like Ludo King or Carrom Pool on their delivery riders' phones.Can't we even play Ludo in peace without being spied on by our employers? Does even downtime need to be tracked by Swiggy? It’s embarrassing that Swiggy feels the need to include these ridiculous app queries on their delivery riders' phones.Speaking of personal loan apps in India, their predatory practices are well documented. A couple of years ago, there was a major crackdown that led to the removal of thousands of such apps from the Play Store. I took a look at some that still exist. Kreditbee is listed as one of the top apps in the personal loans space on the play store with over 50 million downloads. And can you believe their app checks for 860 apps installed on your phone? 860!!! I am sorry you may have to squint or zoom in a little to view this list. ￼I only skimmed through this list - there are just too many apps. I hope someone reading this can do a thorough analysis. It's probably because of the bubble I live in, but I hadn’t even heard of most of these apps. Even though most of them have tens of millions of downloads.Beyond the usual categories, I see there are checks for apps like Tamil Calendar, Odia Calendar, Qibla Direction Finder, mandir apps, astrology apps. They know what they’re doing.There is \"Jodii for Diploma, +2,10 below\", a matrimony app for those who haven’t graduated high school. It has 10M+ downloads.Then there is also \"गाय भैंस खरीदें बेचें Animall\" (cow buy/sell marketplace?) which also has more than 10M downloads.This list of apps is a window into how a large part of India uses their phones - their daily lives, habits, and priorities. Another leading personal loan app, Moneyview, with over 50 million downloads, has included checks for a staggering 944 apps in its manifest file - the highest among all the apps I examined. I am not including it in this post, you can read the full list here. I'm surprised KreditBee and Moneyview apps passed the Play Store's review. Play Store policy explicitly restricts personal loan apps from using the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission.  But these apps are bypassing this restriction by individually listing every app they want to detect in their manifest file instead.I found only one manifest file which had the high-risk and sensitive QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission - it was Cred’s. Play Store grants a \"temporary exception\" to include this permission if apps have “a verifiable core purpose facilitating financial-transactions involving financially regulated instruments”.  But none of the other apps in the same segment as Cred I analyzed like PhonePe or PayTM had this permission in their manifest files. In fact, Cred offers personal loans too which as per Play Store’s Personal loans policy, is not eligible for this exception. Not sure how Cred is still allowed to keep this permission, which lets it see all the apps on your phone without any disclosures.I read the manifest files of around 50 popular apps from Indian companies. Apart from Swiggy, Zepto, Cred, and a couple of personal loan apps, most had fairly reasonable and respectful app query lists. Guess I expected worse. Maybe I am too cynical about these apps - could they actually be the good guys? 🙃As I was about to conclude this exercise, I noticed a couple of interesting lines when I was skimming through the manifest file of one of the apps:<queries>\n  [...]\n  <intent>\n    <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n  </intent>\n  [...]\n</queries>I am no expert in Android development, but from what I understand, the \"ACTION_MAIN\" filter in the configuration above allows visibility to all installed apps that, simply put, have a screen.Since most installed apps run in the foreground and have a user interface, this filter grants developers access to see all the apps on your phone - without needing the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission!To be sure, I vibe co -- I can't say it without wincing -- I vibe coded a basic android app and added the same \"ACTION_MAIN\" filter in my manifest file. And when I queried for installed packages, just as expected, this little hack returned a list of all the apps on my phone!!!This seems like a massive privacy loophole in Android. Surely Play Store would reject apps that use this hack as this is a blatant violation of their store's user data policy? Out of 47 Indian apps I randomly analyzed, 31 of them used the \"ACTION_MAIN\" filter - giving them access to see all the apps on your phone without any disclosure. That's 2 out of 3 apps.Apps using this hack: Astrotalk, Axis Mobile, Bajaj Finserv, BookMyShow, Cars24, Cure.fit, Fibe, Groww, Housing, Instamart, Ixigo, JioHotstar, KreditBee, KukuTV, LazyPay, Ludo King, Meesho, MoneyTap, Moneyview, Navi, NoBroker, Nykaa, Ola, PhonePe, PhysicsWallah, Slice, Spinny, Swiggy, Swiggy Delivery, Tata Neu, and Zomato.Apps that don't use this hack: Airtel Thanks, Blinkit, Byju’s, MyGate, Dream11, Flipkart, HDFC Mobile, Healthify, INDmoney, MyJio, Paytm, PaisaBazaar, ShareChat, Unacademy, Vedantu, ZeptoEven fucking Ludo King has this in its manifest file. So most Indian companies can actually see all the apps on your phone - they're just sneakier about it than the likes of Swiggy and Zepto. So much for being the good guys.In fact, Swiggy has got this filter config too, yet it still chooses to explicitly lists the apps it queries when it could just as easily do this discreetly behind closed doors like others. But I’m not complaining. This oversight from them gives a glimpse into Swiggy’s data collection practices. If Google had enforced this policy properly, we might have had similar visibility into other companies as well.All the manifest files I read are in my Github. The majority were downloaded on March 18 or 19.This hack isn’t exclusively used by apps from Indian companies. I checked the manifest files of some other popular apps. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Subway Surfers, and Truecaller all have this config. Meanwhile, Amazon, Spotify, X, Discord, and WhatsApp didn’t. I didn’t investigate further beyond these.This makes me wonder, what was the whole purpose of Google's package visibility policy? It was supposed to protect users, yet most apps seem to have found ways around it anyway.And installed app data is very sensitive and personal. In 2022, Vice reported that a data marketplace called Narrative was selling data on users who had downloaded period-tracking apps right after news emerged that Roe v. Wade (which had federally protected abortion rights in the U.S.) could be overturned. This is frightening to even think about. Installed apps data is one data point. The extensive set of permissions each and every one of these apps have included in their manifest files, often far beyond what’s necessary is another can of worm for someone else to open. I’ll conclude this post with a tiny example from Zepto. They ask for READ_SMS permission. You can deny it, but it’s mandatory if you sign up for Zepto Postpaid. When you grant the permission, this is the list of sender IDs they check for in your inbox:Most of them are TRAI sender IDs of banks. They're likely reading these for their Postpaid plan eligibility check. They can still read this even if you never opt for it. And look how they've sneaked in SMSes from Blinkit, Swiggy, Bigbasket, Flipkart too.Their competitors are probably doing the same, they just didn’t leave behind such an obvious trail of evidence in the app itself. The point is when any app gets permissions like READ_SMS, as users, we have no visibility over when or what it’s accessing.Please remember the next time you casually install an app on your Android device, this information is being broadcast to the whole world. Data brokers will use it to profile you, cross-reference it with data about you from other ad networks and eventually it will be used to decide how much you’ll be asked to pay the next time you order a samosa.Thank you for reading.

Since Android 11 in 2022, this access has been restricted. Apps can only see other apps if it's essential for their functionality, and they must declare these in their configuration files.\n\n2. **Excessive Queries**: Some Indian apps, like Swiggy and Zepto, have been found to list an excessive number of other apps in their manifest files—154 for Swiggy and 165 for Zepto. This raises concerns about user profiling and privacy violations.\n\n3. **Exceptions for Specific Uses**: While some checks for installed apps are legitimate (e.g., payment apps), many queries seem unnecessary for the core functions of these apps.\n\n4. **Employers' Tracking**: Delivery apps like Swiggy and Zepto also monitor which other companies their delivery riders work for, raising privacy issues regarding their personal lives.\n\n5. **Loopholes in Privacy Policies**: A significant privacy loophole allows apps to access a complete list of installed apps without proper permissions by using a specific configuration filter. This was found in 31 out of 47 apps analyzed.\n\n6. **Data Privacy Risks**: The article emphasizes that installed app data is sensitive and can be exploited by data brokers, leading to potential misuse, such as targeted advertising or pricing discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, users should be cautious when installing apps, as their data may be more accessible to companies than they realize.",

Print                     Comment                  Village Roadshow Entertainment has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a dark turn for the once-prolific film financing company that backed the “Joker,” “The Matrix” and “Ocean’s Eleven” movie franchises. The West Hollywood company blamed its ongoing legal battle with longtime partner Warner Bros. for its collapse, according to a Monday filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Village Roadshow also conceded that its ambitious push into producing independent films and television programs before the pandemic was unprofitable, exacerbating its financial woes. The breach of contract lawsuit against Warner Bros. came after the studio introduced “The Matrix Resurrections” in December 2021 on its HBO Max streaming service the same day the film was released in movie theaters. Village Roadshow complained that the Burbank studio’s pivot away from an exclusive theatrical release  had destroyed the value of a key franchise.  Advertisement    Village Roadshow’s predicament is a stark example of how the entertainment industry’s shift to streaming has upended once-vibrant businesses. Since its founding in 1997, Village Roadshow has co-produced and co-financed more than 100 movies that together generated more than $19 billion in worldwide box office receipts, according to court documents.“A confluence of macro-economic factors have weighed heavily on the company’s balance sheet,” Keith Maib, an executive with Accordion Partners who is serving as chief restructuring officer for the Village Roadshow liquidation, wrote in a declaration.  Advertisement    The disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 writers’ and actors’ strikes and major entertainment companies’ embrace of streaming helped crater the company, Maib wrote.The bankruptcy filing was designed to facilitate “orderly sales of the debtor’s assets,” he said.                             Hollywood Inc.           Warner Bros.’ ‘Matrix’ legal slugfest exposes Hollywood’s shifting priorities         The fight between Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. could mark the breakup of a 25-year partnership. What went wrong?     Feb. 21, 2022        Village Roadshow is controlled by Vine Media Opportunities, Falcon Strategic Partners and a Canadian limited partnership, 1397225 Ontario Ltd. Advertisement    The company said its assets are worth an estimated $100 million to $500 million.But it has more than 200 creditors and debts of $500 million to $1 billion, according to the filing.Village Roadshow owes more than $11 million to Kirkland & Ellis in Los Angeles for professional services. Its debt to the Writers Guild of America West tops $1.4 million. (The WGA put Village Roadshow on its strike list in December for nonpayment.) The filing also shows that Village Roadshow owes Bryan Cranston’s Moonshot Entertainment Inc. $794,000 for development costs and $250,000 to Sony Pictures Television. Former Sony executive Steve Mosko, who joined Village Roadshow in 2018 as chief executive, left this year. He had attempted to build Village Roadshow into an independent studio that produced its own movies and television shows.But the Mosko-led campaign to remake the company into a full-service studio proved costly and untimely.               Hollywood Inc.           After years of making other studios’ movies, Village Roadshow wants homegrown hits, too        Australian film company Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, known for co-financing and co-producing movies such as “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “American Sniper,” is looking to develop movies in-house.     April 19, 2017        Village Roadshow put into development 99 feature films, 166 scripted television series and 67 unscripted series. Of those, six movies and seven television series went into production. “No film or television series that was produced was able to create a profit that could sustain the studio business,” Maib wrote. Village Roadshow’s legal battle with Warner Bros. was the last straw. The company’s dispute against Warner Bros. remains unresolved in arbitration — more then three years after the lawsuit was filed.In late 2021, Warner Bros. was recalibrating because of the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company, then owned by AT&T, was prioritizing gaining subscribers to support its streaming service over its traditional business of releasing movies to cinemas. That’s when it placed “The Matrix Resurrections” on HBO Max.Village Roadshow said it has spent more than $18 million in legal fees to try to resolve the Warner Bros. dispute — fees that remain unpaid.While the firm also worked on movies with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Paramount Pictures, its most valuable assets were produced in conjunction with Warner Bros., including “Mad Max: Fury Road” and “The Lego Movie.” The company co-produced and co-financed 91 films with Warner Bros. by arranging some $4.5 billion in financing.Village Roadshow’s library assets generate about $50 million a year in revenue, according to Maib’s declaration.                             Hollywood Inc.           ‘Matrix Resurrections’ co-producer sues Warner Bros. over HBO Max release         Village Roadshow, which has co-financed and co-produced Warner Bros. movies for decades, accused the studio of killing the value of the ‘Matrix’ franchise.     Feb. 7, 2022        Last year, Village Roadshow  engaged Goldman Sachs Group to sell some library assets, but uncertainty caused by the lingering Warner Bros. dispute scuttled the effort. The company then engaged Sheppard Mullin Richter and Solic Capital Advisors, which came up with a “stalking horse bidder” to buy the assets following the Chapter 11 process, Maib wrote.

      "en": "Village Roadshow Entertainment has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, primarily due to a legal dispute with Warner Bros. and unprofitable ventures into independent film and television. The company, known for backing popular franchises like \"Joker\" and \"The Matrix,\" reported debts between $500 million to $1 billion, with assets valued at $100 million to $500 million. The shift to streaming and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic further strained its finances. Village Roadshow has been in a legal battle with Warner Bros. since 2021, claiming that the studio's decision to release \"The Matrix Resurrections\" on HBO Max simultaneously with theaters harmed the franchise's value. The company has also incurred significant legal costs in this dispute. Once a major player, Village Roadshow's workforce has significantly decreased as it struggles to remain viable in a changing entertainment landscape.",

She also received a four-year prison sentence. Follow our liveblog to see how events unfold.\n\n                                                                A French court found Marine Le Pen guilty Monday in an embezzlement case and followed up the verdict with a sentence barring her immediately from running for office for five years.Le Pen abruptly left the Paris courtroom before hearing how long she will be banned from running for public office.Le Pen and 24 other officials from her National Rally were accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to pay staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc’s regulations. Le Pen and her co-defendants deny wrongdoing.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 18:13Le Pen's nationalist, Eurosceptic allies brand court ruling an attack on democracy\n                                                FRANCE 24's Philip Turle has more on the European far-right leaders who have rallied in support of their French ally Marine Le Pen.The fact that the French far-right leader has been found guilty of embezzling EU funds has further incensed her allies across the continent, who are all deeply suspicious of Brussels and European integration.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 17:53National Rally leader Bardella urges 'peaceful' protest after Le Pen verdict\n                                                Marine Le Pen's protégé Jordan Bardella, who succeeded her as leader of the National Rally, has called for a \"peaceful mobilisation\" after today's guilty verdict.The 29-year-old earlier said the court's verdict banning Le Pen from running in elections had \"killed\" French democracy.Bardella's party has launched a petition entitled \"Let's save democracy, let's support Marine\", warning that \"a part of the justice system is seeking to triumph where our adversaries have failed\".\"It isno longer the government of judges, but the dictatorship of judges, which wishes to prevent the French people from expressing themselves,” the text reads.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 17:20French prime minister 'troubled' by Le Pen conviction, source says\n                                                French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is \"troubled\" by the embezzlement ruling against Le Pen, a source close to him told AFP.Bayrou does not plan to make \"any statement on a judicial ruling\", the source added.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 17:14How Le Pen turned France's far right into political force\n                                                Marine Le Pen is credited with transforming what was once known as the National Front into a serious political force. Nine years ago, a court in France fined her late father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the party, for calling the Holocaust gas chambers a “detail of history”. Since then, Marine Le Pen publically broke with her father, and set about attempting to clean up the party's image, including renaming it the National Rally.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 17:11Decision to ban France's Le Pen from election will 'backfire', says Elon Musk\n                                                Elon Musk, the billionaire top adviser to US President Donald Trump, called a French court ruling barring far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for election in 2027 \"abuse\".\"This will backfire, like the legal attacks against President Trump,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 16:48How might Le Pen's appeal play out?\n                                                FRANCE 24's Marc Perelman explains how a potential appeal by Le Pen might play out ahead of France's 2027 presidential election.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 16:45Brazil's Bolsonaro calls ruling against Le Pen 'left-wing judicial activism'\n                                                Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that sentence barring Le Pen from seeking public office for five years was \"left-wing judicial activism\" of the kind he has faced in Brazil.In 2023, Bolsonaro was barred from public office until 2030 for abuse of power ahead of the 2022 elections, when he summoned ambassadors to attack the legitimacy of Brazil's voting system.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 16:40France's Socialist Party calls for respect for judiciary and 'rule of law'\n                                                France's Socialist Party called for “respect for the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law”, in a statement following Le Pen's conviction.The party said it \"takes note\" of the court's decision, \"as it would have done for any other\", and called on \"each and every one of us to respect the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law\".\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 16:24Parisians celebrate and criticise Le Pen verdict\n                                                At Paris’s Place de la République today, members of the public were divided over whether to celebrate or criticise the Le Pen verdict.“We were here in this square to celebrate the death of her father,” Jean Dupont, 45, a schoolteacher told AP. “And this is now the death of Le Pen’s presidential ambitions.”Sophie Martin, 34, a graphic designer, was among those in a celebratory mood. “I had to check the date - I thought it was April Fool’s Day,” she said. “But it’s not. She’s finally been knocked down. We’ve lived with her poison in our politics for too long.”But Lucien Bernard, 64, a retired civil servant, expressed concern. “It’s a sad day for democracy,” he said. “Whether you love or hate her, the people should not be denied a chance to express their vote in a country that is supposedly a leading Western democracy.”\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:51NR party holds crisis meeting\n                                                Le Pen and the staff of the National Rally met at the party's Paris headquarters on Monday afternoon to hold a crisis meeting in the wake of their leader's sentence of immediate ineligibility, which jeopardizes her bid for the 2027 presidential election.Attendees included NR president Jordan Bardella, Perpignan mayor Louis Aliot, MP Laurent Jacobelli, MEP Catherine Griset, MP Bruno Bilde and Marine-Caroline Le Pen, sister of the three-time presidential candidate.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:43Le Pen verdict 'sending shockwaves' at National Rally HQ\n                                                FRANCE 24's Carys Garland reports from outside the National Rally party's headquarters in Paris.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:37German lawmaker says Le Pen sentence 'should be a warning to corrupt politicians'\n                                                Marine Le Pen's sentencing should \"be a warning to all corrupt politicians on the left and right fringes\" said German Christian Democratic Union politician Jürgen Hardt.\"As a Member of the European Parliament, Marine Le Pen saw the European Union only as a self-service store with which she could finance herself and her party. The French court is right to put a stop to her political ambitions,\" Hardt said. \"Le Pen's fate should be a warning to all corrupt politicians on the left and right fringes: In a democratic nation of law, fraud and corruption always come to light at some point.\"\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:32\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:04Le Pen in 'fighting mood' after conviction, party spokesman says\n                                                Le Pen is in a \"fighting mood\" following her conviction, said Laurent Jacobelli, a RN lawmaker and party spokesman.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 15:04What has Le Pen been convicted of?\n                                                Le Pen and 24 other officials from the National Rally were accused of diverting over 4.1 million euros intended for EU parliamentary aides to pay staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc’s regulations. Le Pen denied accusations she orchestrated a system to siphon off EU money to benefit her party, which she led from 2011 to 2021. She argued that it was acceptable to adapt the work of the aides paid by the European Parliament to the needs of the lawmakers, including some political work related to the party.But Judge Benedicte de Perthuis disagreed, ruling that Le Pen had been at the heart of “a system” that her party used to misappropriate EU parliament money. She was found guilty of embezzlement along with eight other people who were EU lawmakers at the time and 12 parliamentary assistants.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 14:53Le Pen to appeal conviction, lawyer says\n                                                Le Pen will appeal her conviction for embezzlement of public funds, her lawyer said, after a court handed her a five-year ban on running for office.\"It's a blow to democracy,\" Rodolphe Bosselut told reporters outside her National Rally (RN) party's Paris headquarters.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 14:52Le Pen ruling divides French politicians\n                                                While some of France's politicians have supported the court's ruling against Le Pen others, from both sides of the political spectrum, have expressed concern over its impact on democracy.\"It is not healthy that in a democracy, an elected official is prohibited from standing in an election and I believe that political debates should be decided at the ballot box,\" said the leader of MPs in parliament of the right-wing Republicans, Laurent Wauquiez.The leader of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) Jean-Luc Melenchon appeared ill at ease with the ruling. \"The decision to remove an elected official should be up to the people,\" he said.His party added that it did not think the ruling would cause the demise of the RN. \"France Unbowed has never expected to use the courts as a way to get rid of the National Rally. We fight them at the ballot box and in the streets…We will fight again tomorrow in the polls, whoever is their candidate,\" it said.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 14:44Le Pen had 'shocked' reaction to verdict\n                                                FRANCE 24's Shirli Sitbon reports from Marine Le Pen's trial in Paris.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 14:03What does the verdict mean for Le Pen's presidential hopes?\n                                                The verdict delivers a massive blow to Le Pen, a three-time presidential contender who has previously said the 2027 vote would be her final tilt at top office.Polls have shown Le Pen to be a front-runner in the 2027 race. The RN is the biggest single party in parliament thanks to broadened support among younger and blue-collar voters.Typically in most cases in France, sentences are not applied until any appeals process has run its course. However judges imposed an immediate five-year ban on Le Pen running for office regardless of any appeal, via a so-called \"provisional execution\" measure.The provisional execution ban will not see Le Pen removed from her seat in parliament until her mandate ends, but it will prevent her from running in any fresh electoral contest, blocking her 2027 run.\n\n                        31/03/2025 - 13:59Le Pen was ‘on the road to victory’ says niece and politician Marechal\n                                                “The only reason why Marine Le Pen was condemned is because she was on the road to victory,” said French far-right politician and Le Pen’s niece, Marion Marechal.\n\nThe biggest concern for Le Pen was that the court may declare her ineligible to run for office preventing her from running for president in 2027 -- a scenario she had described as a “political death.”The Constitutional Council ruled Friday, in a separate case, that imposing the punishment immediately was constitutional.Read moreFrench far-right leader Marine Le Pen faces verdict that could end 2027 presidential bidLe Pen, 56, was runner-up to President Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections, and her party’s electoral support has grown in recent years.During the nine-week trial that took place in late 2024, she argued that ineligibility “would have the effect of depriving me of being a presidential candidate\" and disenfranchise her supporters.“There are 11 million people who voted for the movement I represent. So tomorrow, potentially, millions and millions of French people would see themselves deprived of their candidate in the election,” she told the panel of three judges.\n\n        To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.\n        Accept\n        Manage my choices\n\n        One of your browser extensions seems to be blocking the video player from loading.

successor would be Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s 29-year-old protégé who succeeded her at the helm of the party in 2021.Le Pen denied accusations she was at the head of “a system” meant to siphon off EU parliament money to benefit her party, which she led from 2011 to 2021.She argued instead that it was acceptable to adapt the work of the aides paid by the European Parliament to the needs of the lawmakers, including some highly political work related to the party, which was called the National Front at the time.While testifying, Le Pen told the court: “I absolutely don’t feel I have committed the slightest irregularity, the slightest illegal move.”\n\n        To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.\n        Accept\n

to declare Le Pen guilty, requesting a two-year prison sentence and a five-year period of ineligibility.Le Pen said she felt they were “only interested” in preventing her from running for president.The Kremlin on Monday slammed the ruling as 'violating democratic norms'.\"More and more European capitals are going down the path of violating democratic norms,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing when asked about the decision.Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban took to X soon after the sentencing to show his support for Le Pen posting simply, 'Je suis Marine!' appropriating the 'Je suis Charlie' slogan that united France after the offices of Charlie Hebdo were targeted by terrorists in 2015.Prosecutors also requested a guilty verdict for all the other co-defendants, including various sentences of up to one year in prison and a €2 million ($2.2 million) fine for the party.(FRANCE 24 with AP, AFP and Reuters)\n\n

      "en": "A French court has banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office for five years due to embezzlement charges. She was found guilty of misusing over 4 million euros intended for European Union parliamentary aides to pay staff for her party, the National Rally, from 2004 to 2016. Along with the ban, Le Pen received a four-year prison sentence, although she plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nLe Pen's conviction has sparked mixed reactions in France. Supporters from the far-right see it as an attack on democracy, while others, including politicians from various parties, express concerns about the implications for democratic processes. Some public celebrations followed the verdict, while others voiced worries about the court's decision to prevent her from participating in the 2027 presidential election.\n\nLe Pen, who has previously run for president and was a strong contender in recent elections, argues the ruling undermines the voice of her supporters. Her party's leadership is now in question, with her protégé, Jordan Bardella, potentially stepping into a larger role. The court's decision has drawn international attention, with figures like Elon Musk and Jair Bolsonaro commenting on it as an example of political bias.",

I'm just glad I don't have any strong genetic traits for any pre-existing conditions that would make health insurance companies think twice before writing a policy for me.\nNow, on top of all this data just lying around out there getting easier and easier to obtain, we have AI vacuuming up all our data to make it easier than ever to track our every move.\nSure, there are efforts afoot to better protect our privacy. This includes government regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and America's California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which seeks to ensure that companies handle personal data responsibly. Whatever that means.\nAnd there are many things you can do to protect your privacy. Edward Snowden – remember him? – had some useful suggestions on how to shield yourself back in 2015, and they're still helpful today.\nFrankly, it's too late to put the privacy genie back in the bottle. The best you can do is reduce how public you make your life. For example, with not quite a million CCTV cameras in London, or about one camera for every ten people, you don't want to live there if you object to being surveilled. In the online world, if you don't wish to have online snoopers tracking you, you don't want to spend time on heavily monitored social networks such as Facebook and X.\nThe bottom line is you can't avoid some exposure these days. For example, your smartphone is constantly tracking you. The best you can do is minimize your exposure by turning off location tracking services.

However, insect predation strategies in the fossil record remain poorly understood.ResultsHere, we describe †Sirenobethylus charybdis n. gen. & sp., based on sixteen adult female wasps in Kachin amber from the mid-Cretaceous, 99 Mya (million years ago), and place it in Chrysidoidea: †Sirenobethylidae n. fam. The fossils display unique morphological modifications on the tip of the abdomen consisting of three flaps from the modified abdominal sternum 6 and tergum and sternum 7; the lower flap formed from sternum 6 is preserved in different positions relative to the other flaps in different specimens, indicating that they form some sort of grasping apparatus. Nothing similar is known from any other insect; the rounded abdominal apparatus, combined with the setae along the edges, is reminiscent of a Venus flytrap. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new family is a separate lineage close to the base of Chrysidoidea.Conclusions†Sirenobethylus probably was a koinobiont parasitoid wasp; the abdominal grasping apparatus may have been used to temporarily immobilize the host during oviposition. The new fossils suggest that Chrysidoidea displayed a wider range of parasitoid strategies in the mid-Cretaceous than they do today.\n\n                    BackgroundInsects are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, with more than 1 million described species and probably several times more undescribed; recent estimates suggest approximately 5.5 million species in total [1, 2]. Their highly adaptable exoskeleton has allowed them to radiate and colonize a wide range of habitats and develop highly efficient and innovative solutions to a range of challenges posed by their surroundings [3, 4]. Among other mechanisms, carnivorous insects have evolved a range of prey capture mechanisms [5, 6]: the forelegs of praying mantises (Mantodea) and mantis flies (Neuroptera: Mantispidae) [7]; the capture basket formed by the spiny legs of adult dragonflies (Odonata); the prehensile labial ‘mask’ employed by dragonfly nymphs [8]; the modified fore legs of female dryinid wasps (Hymenoptera: Dryinidae) for immobilizing hosts temporarily [9]; the hair-trigger mandibles of trap-jaw ants (Formicidae: Odontomachus) [10]; the fore and midlegs of heel-walkers (Mantophasmatodea) for swooping on prey [11]; the large hind tarsal claws of hangingflies (Mecoptera: Bittacidae) for grasping prey [12].The fossil insect fauna from the Cretaceous (Albian – Cenomanian; 99 Mya) Kachin amber provide unique insights into insect evolution [13, 14]; in addition to confirming the ancestry of features observed in modern organisms, it displays occasional examples of ancient morphologies without obvious modern parallels. With regard to potential prey capture mechanisms, the most prominent example so far might be the remarkable mandibles of the ‘saber-tooth’ haidomyrmecine ants [7, 15]. In the present paper, we describe an even more bizarre possible host capture/immobilization mechanism in the abdomen of a chrysidoid wasp. The rounded abdominal apparatus, combined with the setae along the edges, is reminiscent of a Venus flytrap (Droseraceae: Dionaea muscipula), a carnivorous plant using two opposing specialized leaves to capture insect prey [16].ResultsSystematic paleontologyOrder Hymenoptera Linnaeus, 1758.Infraorder Aculeata Latreille, 1802.Superfamily Chrysidoidea Latreille, 1802.Family †Sirenobethylidae Wu, Vilhelmsen & Gao fam. nov.ZooBank LSID: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:EAEC75B2-83B0-4C0E-A4F8-4F18DA024D15.Type genus. †Sirenobethylus Wu, Vilhelmsen & Gao gen. nov.Diagnosis.

Female, CNU-HYM-MA-2015124.Locality and horizon. The amber specimen was collected from Kachin (Hukawng Valley) of northern Myanmar, which is dated at 98.79 ± 0.62 Mya [17, 18].Description. See Additional file 1: Figs. S1–S16, Dataset S1 [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27], Additional file 2: Table S1.DiscussionPhylogenetic position of †Sirenobethylus gen. nov.We describe a new genus †Sirenobethylus, from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber, based on sixteen specimens. The new genus is readily attributed to the Aculeata by its concealed posterior abdominal segments and ovipositor apparatus [28]. †Sirenobethylus has 9 flagellomeres and forewing with 8 closed cells, which is different from Vespoidea sensu lato [29] and Apoidea (antenna with 10 flagellomeres in female and forewing usually has 10 or 9 closed cells) [30, 31]. Therefore, †Sirenobethylus probably belongs to Chrysidoidea. We retrieve this superfamily as monophyletic (Fig.4, Additional file 1: Dataset S2) [32], unlike some recent molecular studies [33].All †Sirenobethylus specimens examined are macropterous females; given the unique diagnostic traits in, e.g., wing venation, and the somewhat isolated phylogenetic position of the new taxon (Fig.4), it is not possible to associate these females with any males known from Kachin amber. They have the forewing venation similar to †Chrysopsenellidae, including a long pterostigma, a closed subdiscal cell, and vein 2m-cu absent (Fig.1A and D). Therefore, the new genus is much more similar to †Chrysopsenellidae than extant groups. However, †Sirenobethylus has comparatively complete hind wing venation, including two closed cells also exhibited by †Plumalexiidae and Plumariidae, but different from other groups of Chrysidoidea [34]. All these features suggest that †Sirenobethylus could be a stem group of Chrysidoidea, which is consistent with our phylogenetic analyses (Fig.4, Additional file 3: Table S2). Furthermore, †Sirenobethylus has a unique combination of diagnostic characters within Chrysidoidea. For these reasons, we place †Sirenobethylus charybdis gen. & sp. n. in its own family, the †Sirenobethylidae.Possibly function of the abdominal apparatusThe abdominal apparatus of †Sirenobethylus, including the sixth sternum and the seventh tergum and sternum, form three superimposed horizontal flaps, modified into a complex composite structure. The composite structure is round and resembles that of the Venus flytrap (Droseraceae: Dionaea muscipula), the carnivorous plant that captures insects between its leaves [16]. The upper flap (tergum 7) is elongate and tongue-shaped; the middle flap (sternum 7) extends laterally far beyond the dorsal flap and is extensively membranous. The lower flap (sternum 6) is expanded distally and laterally, forming a paddle-shaped structure (Fig.1B); the thick spines on the dorsal part of the lower flap are elongate and scattered in the middle, but shorter and more densely placed along the edges (Additional file 4: Video S1). Furthermore, micro-CT (micro computed tomography) reconstruction shows two apodemes on the anterolateral corners of the lower flap, just inside the constriction where the sternum 6 meets the posterior margin of sternum 5 (Additional file 5: Video S2). The posterior margin of the lower flap has a dozen very long, slender setae extending from it. The tip of the abdomen often has numerous setae in the extant Aculeata, but they are not as long [35, 36]. The eighth tergum of †Sirenobethylus is hidden beneath the upper flap and the sting and is shorter than the upper flap (Fig.2D). The sting of †Sirenobethylus extends through a groove on the dorsal side of the middle flap, below the upper flap; the sting sheaths are situated on either side of the sting, and are apparently shorter than the sting (Fig.1C). Among the existing Aculeata with stings, most have sheaths that are about as long as the sting itself [28].Fig.2Photographs and micro-CT reconstructions (volume renderings) of †Sirenobethylus charybdis sp. nov., paratype (specimen CNU-HYM-MA2015119) female.

Scale bars: A 0.5mm; B–D 0.2mm. Abbreviations: S6 sternum 6; S7 sternum 7; T8 tergum 8Full size imageThe abdominal apparatus of †Sirenobethylus is unlike anything previously reported from any extant wasp or indeed any insect known to us [5, 37]. From the morphology and the different states of position of the lower flap preserved in different specimens, it seems evident that the apparatus had some grasping function. We consider two different possible usages for the apparatus: 1) It may have had a function during mating, restraining the male. Due to the lack of male fossil evidence, we cannot determine the role of the apparatus in the mating process. Indeed, it would be unique for insect females to restrain the males during mating, rather than the other way around. We consider this an unlikely function of the abdominal apparatus. 2) It might have served to restrain a host temporarily during oviposition. We consider this to be the most likely function of the abdominal apparatus and will elaborate on this in the following.The fortuitous preservation of the flaps in different relative positions in various specimens of †Sirenobethylus, i.e., ‘open’ with the lower flap depressed relative to the middle and dorsal flaps (Figs. 3F–H, Additional file 1: Figs. S2, S10, S13) versus ‘closed’ with the ventral flap closely appressed to the middle and dorsal flaps (Figs. 1C, 2D, 3E, Additional file 1: Figs. S4, S5, S7, S9, S11, S14, S16) indicates that together they form a grasping apparatus. The very elongate hairs along the posterior margin of the ventral flap (Figs. 1D, 3C and D) might have served as ‘trigger hairs’ forewarning the parasitoid of an approaching host and perhaps indicating the host's position based on the number of hairs that the host touches [38]. The setae on the lower flap are long and sparse in the middle, and short and dense along the edges and presumably flexible (Fig.2D); the extensive membranous areas on the middle flap (Fig.2B) appear relatively soft. We speculate that the coarse setal brush inside the ventral flap and the extensive membranous areas on the middle flap might have served to cushion the host during oviposition rather than crushing it, indicating that the host may not have been permanently incapacitated during the procedure and that †Sirenobethylus might have been a koinobiont parasitoid rather than a predator [27]. For these reasons, we suggest that the abdominal apparatus could have served to temporarily grasp and immobilize the host during oviposition. In addition, the sting of †Sirenobethylus is situated in a groove on the dorsal side of the middle flap, and among the sixteen specimens, six specimens have stings preserved with grooves directed downward, which would allow the †Sirenobethylus to easily sting the captured host (Figs. 1C, 3E–G, Additional file 1: Figs. S5F, S8G, S10D, S11D, S12H, S16E).Fig.3Photographs of †Sirenobethylus charybdis sp. nov. females. (A, B) Lateral view of specimens CNU-HYM-MA2015132 and CNU-HYM-MA2015125.

Scale bars: A–D 0.5mm; E–H 0.2mmFull size imageBased on the reconstruction from micro-CT data (Fig.2, Additional file 4: Video S1, Additional file 5: Video S2), the lower flap rotates around the point where sternum 6 is overlapped ventrally by sternum 5. Adductor muscles inserting on the lower side of the anterolateral apodemes would raise the lower flap towards the middle flap, closing the apparatus, whereas abductor muscles inserting on the upper part of the apodemes would depress the lower flap away from the middle flap. For quick operation, especially when closing the apparatus to grasp the host, the muscles would have to be of substantial size. We speculate that the abductors and adductors might have arisen from tergum 3 and sternum 3, respectively; these are the largest sclerites in the abdomen and each have a transverse line on their anterior part that might indicate the attachment sites of the muscles.The extant Chrysidoidea sensu lato [27, 30] display a range of life histories: parasitoids of wood-living beetle larvae (Scolebythidae), parasitoids of beetle or Lepidoptera larvae (Bethylidae), parasitoids of sawfly cocoons (Chrysididae: Cleptinae), egg-parasitoids of stick insects (Chrysididae: Amiseginae and Loboscelidinae), kleptoparasitoids in nests of solitary bees or wasps (Chrysididae: Chrysidinae), parasitoids of nymphs of webspinners/embiopterans (Sclerogibbidae) or parasitoids of nymphs of Auchenorrhyncha (Dryinidae, Embolemidae) [27]. Given this diversity and the lack of information from a number of chrysidoid families, including the extant Plumariidae, it is not possible to infer potential hosts for †Sirenobethylus by mapping lifestyles on the phylogeny, although most of the aforementioned groups have also been reported from Kachin amber [39].The females of some Dryinidae have developed a host restraining apparatus on the forelegs [40]; they use their chelate fore tarsi to immobilize their elusive hosts (leafhoppers, treehoppers and planthoppers) during oviposition. These dryinid females are often wingless, have large eyes and elongate legs, and pursue their hosts actively prior to oviposition [9]. In contrast, †Sirenobethylus was probably not able to pursue hosts over longer distances given the position of the putative capture apparatus at the posterior end of the body and its overall habitus compared to dryinid females (smaller eyes, shorter legs). However, the elaborate grasping apparatus indicates that †Sirenobethylus was indeed targeting highly mobile prey, and the hosts might have been homopteran hoppers (like for dryinids) or small winged insects, like flies, the elongate trigger hairs perhaps eliciting a short posterior lunge if a potential target came within range. We imagine it would have waited with the apparatus open, ready to pounce as soon as a potential host activated the capture response. Our findings suggest that Chrysidoidea displayed a wider range of parasitoid strategies in the mid-Cretaceous than they do today.ConclusionsWe report new mid-Cretaceous fossils of Chrysidoidea, suggesting that †Sirenobethylidae is a separate lineage close to the base of Chrysidoidea based on phylogenetic analysis. Based on our detailed analyses of the morphology of the specimens at our disposal, we infer that †Sirenobethylus was probably a koinobiont parasitoid wasp, the unique grasping mechanism at the tip of the abdomen possibly being used for temporary host capture. Our new findings indicate that by the mid-Cretaceous, some early Chrysidoidea had evolved unique parasitoid strategies.MethodsMaterial availabilityAll specimens were collected from Noije Bum hill, about 18km southwest of Tanai Village in the Hukawng Valley, northern Myanmar (26° 21′ 33.41\" N, 96° 43′ 11.88\" E) [17, 18]. All amber specimens are stored in the Key Lab of Insect Evolution and Environmental Changes, College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University (CNUB; Dong Ren, Curator), Beijing, China. Extant specimens examined are stored in the Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. The wing venation nomenclature is based on Rasnitsyn (1980) [41].No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.Optical microscopy, photographyThe specimens studied were examined and photographed using a Leica M205A stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica DFC425 camera and LAS software. The amber specimens were examined under a Leica M205C stereomicroscope. Figure1 of the holotype specimen, Fig.4 of habitus images of extant specimens and Additional file 1: Fig. S7C and D were taken with a BK + Imaging System from Visionary Digital equipped with a Canon EOS 7D camera. The other images of the amber specimens were taken with a Nikon SMZ 25 microscope with an attached Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera system or a Nikon ECLIPSE Ni microscope with an attached Nikon DS-Ri2 digital camera system.Fig.4Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on morphological characters.

Scanning parameters are as follows: beam strength: 60kV/5w, filter: no, resolution: 1.94μm, exposure time: 5s, number of TIFF images: 1718. Volume rendering and 3D reconstruction were performed using the open-source software Drishti 2.4 [42]. The 3D-reconstruction models of the abdomen of the specimen are displayed in Fig.2, and the original scan data has been deposited in Dryad (Wu et al., 2025; https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4b8gthtq9).Phylogenetic analysisOur phylogenetic analyses included one species of non-aculeate wasp (Trigonalidae: Taeniogonalos gundlachii) as outgroup/root, 19 species of Chrysidoidea (7 fossil, 12 extant), 19 species of Vespoidea (19 extant), and four species of Apoidea (4 extant) as ingroups to clarify the phylogenetic position of the new fossil taxon (see Additional file 3: Table S2). We scored 57 morphological characters (see Additional file 1: Dataset S3) [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50].Bayesian analyses were performed in MrBayes version 3.2.7 [51]. Only variable characters were coded, and non-applicable morphological characters were treated as missing data. Equal transition probabilities between the states and among-character rate variation were assumed, allowing the different characters to evolve at different rates. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis used the Mk model, were conducted with four independent runs. Convergence was assessed by the average standard deviation of split frequencies (ASDSF < 0.01), and the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF < 1.005). After 20 million generations, the topology converged with an ASDSF < 0.004, and PSRF values < 1.001. 50% of the generations were then discarded as burn-in. The posterior probabilities were plotted as relative branch support in the final tree (allcompat. tre) using FigTree v.1.4.3 [52]. The halfcompat. tree can be found in the Additional file 1: Fig. S17.\n                    Data availability\n\n              All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this article and its supplementary information files.

      "en": "This research paper describes a new genus and species of a fossil wasp named **Sirenobethylus charybdis**, found in Kachin amber from the mid-Cretaceous period, around 99 million years ago. The study identifies unique features in the wasp's abdomen, including three modified flaps that may function as a grasping mechanism, similar to a Venus flytrap. These adaptations likely allowed the wasp to temporarily immobilize its host during egg-laying (oviposition).\n\nThe findings suggest that this wasp represents a distinct lineage within the group of wasps known as Chrysidoidea, indicating that these insects had a broader range of parasitoid strategies in the mid-Cretaceous than they do today. The study also highlights the evolutionary significance of these fossils in understanding insect predation strategies over millions of years. \n\nOverall, the research sheds light on the diverse adaptations of insects and expands our understanding of their evolutionary history.",
      "ko": "이 연구 논문은 약 9900만 년 전 중생대 백악기에서 발견된 화석 말벌의 새로운 속과 종인 **Sirenobethylus charybdis**에 대해 설명합니다. 이 연구는 말벌의 배 부분에서 발견된 독특한 특징들을 확인했으며, 그 중 세 개의 변형된 플랩이 손잡이 역할을 할 수 있는 구조로, 이는 벌레를 잡는 식물인 비너스 플라이트랩과 유사합니다. 이러한 적응은 말벌이 알을 낳을 때 숙주를 일시적으로 immobilize하는 데 도움을 주었을 것으로 보입니다.\n\n연구 결과는 이 말벌이 Chrysidoidea라는 말벌 그룹 내에서 독특한 계통을 나타내며, 중생대 백악기 당시 이 곤충들이 오늘날보다 더 다양한 기생 전략을 가지고 있었음을 시사합니다. 또한 이 연구는 수백만 년에 걸친 곤충의 포식 전략을 이해하는 데 있어 이러한 화석의 진화적 중요성을 강조합니다.\n\n전반적으로 이 연구는 곤충의 다양한 적응을 조명하고 그들의 진화 역사에 대한 이해를 넓히는 데 기여합니다.",
      "ja": "この研究論文では、約9900万年前の中生代白亜紀にカチン琥珀から発見された新しい属と種の化石ハチ、**Sirenobethylus charybdis**について説明しています。この研究では、ハチの腹部に見られる独特の特徴を特定しており、特に三つの変形したフラップが注目されています。これらのフラップは、ウツボカズラのように捕まえる機能を持つ可能性があります。これらの適応により、ハチは卵を産む際に宿主を一時的に動けなくすることができたと考えられています。\n\nこの発見は、このハチがクリシドイデアと呼ばれるハチのグループ内で独自の系統を示していることを示唆しています。これは、白亜紀中期のこれらの昆虫が、現在よりも広範な寄生戦略を持っていたことを意味します。また、この研究は、数百万年にわたる昆虫の捕食戦略を理解する上で、これらの化石の進化的意義を強調しています。\n\n全体として、この研究は昆虫の多様な適応を明らかにし、彼らの進化の歴史に対する理解を深めるものです。"

No one knows why.\nXiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.\nHe has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.\n“None of this is in any way normal”\nIn recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.\n\n            As reported by the Bloomingtonian and later the Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma and located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.\n\nAttempts to locate Wang and Ma have so far been unsuccessful. An Indiana University spokesman didn't answer emailed questions asking if the couple was still employed by the university and why their profile pages, email addresses, and phone numbers had been removed. The spokesman provided the contact information for a spokeswoman at the FBI's field office in Indianapolis. In an email, the spokeswoman wrote: \"The FBI conducted court authorized law enforcement activity at homes in Bloomington and Carmel Friday. We have no further comment at this time.\"\nSearches of federal court dockets turned up no documents related to Wang, Ma, or any searches of their residences. The FBI spokeswoman didn't answer questions seeking which US district court issued the warrant and when, and whether either Wang or Ma is being detained by authorities. Justice Department representatives didn't return an email seeking the same information. An email sent to a personal email address belonging to Wang went unanswered at the time this post went live. Their resident status (e.g. US citizens or green card holders) is currently unknown.\nFellow researchers took to social media over the weekend to register their concern over the series of events.\n\"None of this is in any way normal,\" Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Mastodon. He continued: \"Has anyone been in contact? I hear he’s been missing for two weeks and his students can’t reach him. How does this not get noticed for two weeks???\"\nIn the same thread, Matt Blaze, a McDevitt professor of computer science and law at Georgetown University, said: \"It's hard to imagine what reason there could be for the university to scrub its website as if he never worked there. And while there's a process for removing tenured faculty, it takes more than an afternoon to do it.\"\n\nLocal news outlets reported the agents spent several hours moving boxes in an out of the residences. WTHR provided the following details about the raid on the Carmel home:\nNeighbors say the agents announced \"FBI, come out!\" over a megaphone.\nA woman came out of the house holding a phone. A video from a neighbor shows an agent taking that phone from her. She was then questioned in the driveway before agents began searching the home, collecting evidence and taking photos.\nA car was pulled out of the garage slightly to allow investigators to access the attic.\nThe woman left the house before 13News arrived. She returned just after noon accompanied by a lawyer. The group of ten or so investigators left a few minutes later.\nThe FBI would not say what they were looking for or who is under investigation. A bureau spokesperson issued a statement: “I can confirm we conducted court-authorized activity at the address in Carmel today. We have no further comment at this time.”\nInvestigators were at the house for about four hours before leaving with several boxes of evidence. 13News rang the doorbell when the agents were gone. A lawyer representing the family who answered the door told us they're not sure yet what the investigation is about.\nThis post will be updated if new details become available.

Across the industry, this includes work being done by individual vendors, that they are then contributing to the standardization process so C++ programmers can use it portably. In the standard, it includes things we have had for a while (UB-free constexpr compile-time code) to things we’ve done recently (in draft C++26: erroneous behavior, bounds-hardened standard library, and contracts for functional safety) to proposals we’re actively pursuing next (in progress: Bjarne Stroustrup’s profiles, Úlfar Erlingsson’s remote code execution hardening).\n\nA common underlying thread of all this work is that each piece addresses more and more of C++’s undefined behavior (aka UB), and especially the UB most exploited by attackers. We’re addressing UB methodically, starting with addressing the common high-value cases that will do the most to harden our code: uninitialized variables, out-of-bounds access, pointer misuse, and the key UB cases that adversaries need to implement remote code execution. These are the weaknesses that attackers exploit, and that we are locking down to lock them out.\n\nCommon (dis)belief: “UB is just too central to C++, trying to improve it enough to matter is hopeless”\n\nFor the sake of discussion, assume the cage is impervious to dragon breath and psionics. It’s just a metaphor.\n\nTech pundits still seem to commonly assume that UB is so fundamentally entangled in C++’s specification and programs that C++ will never be able to address enough UB to really matter. And it is true that it’s currently way too easy to accidentally let tendrils of silent UB slither pervasively throughout our C++ code.\n\nBackground in a nutshell: In C++, code that (usually accidentally) exercises UB is the primary root cause of our memory safety and security vulnerability issues. When a program contains UB, anything can happen; it’s common to call the whole thing “the UB dragon” and say “UB can reformat your hard drive or make demons fly out your nose” — hence the Tiamat and Cthulhu metaphors. Worse than those things, however, is that UB regularly leads to exploitable security vulnerabilities and other expensive-to-fix bugs. (For more details about UB, see the Appendix.)\n\nSo it’s valid to ask: Can and will C++ ever do enough about UB to make a major difference?\n\nSummary and spoilers\n\nIn this post, I’m happy to report that serious taming of C++ UB is underway…\n\n(1) Since C++11 in 2011, more and more C++ code has already become UB-free. Most people just didn’t notice.\n\nSpoiler: All constexpr/consteval compile-time code is UB-free. As of C++26 almost the entire language and much of the standard library is available at compile time, and is UB-free when executed at compile time (but not when the code is executed at run time, hence the following additional work all of which is about run-time execution).\n\n(2) Since March 2024, the draft C++26 standard has already removed key “low-hanging fruit” run-time UB cases that were the root cause of significant categories of security vulnerabilities.\n\nSpoiler: In draft C++26, uninitialized local variables are no longer UB, and most common non-iterator bounds errors in the hardened standard library, such as for string and vector and string_view and span, will no longer be UB in a “hardened” implementation. (And C++26 also has language contracts for a different aspect of safety, namely functional safety for defensive programming to reduce bugs in general.)\n\n(3) Now, we’re undertaking to add more tools and to systematically catalog and address run-time UB in the C++ language.\n\nSpoiler: Addressing each case of UB statically where possible (at compile time), or with run-time checking where necessary. The primary tools: (a) C++26 erroneous behavior (EB); (b) Bjarne Stroustrup’s profiles and Gabriel Dos Reis’ profiles framework to opt into full safety by default and tactically opt out again where needed (sometimes you do want to breathe fire at a specific loop); and/or (c) applying C++26 contract assertions to check language features. EB and basic contract assertions are already part of C++26; profiles have work now underway focusing on implementation and deployment of the profiles framework and a few key profiles for experimentation across the C++ ecosystem. In addition, Úlfar Erlingsson is proposing a profile to surgically eliminate specifically the UB that attackers use to do remote code execution (RCE) which has the promise to eliminate many (and let developers opt into eliminating nearly all) malware exploits in recompiled C++ code.\n\nIf successful, these steps would achieve parity with the other modern memory-safe languages as measured by the number of security vulnerabilities, which would eliminate any safety-related reasons not to use C++. Note that leveling the playing field with other languages still means there are other security issues that need to be addressed too, in all languages, such as logic bugs for functional safety (C++26 contracts will help here); we’re first addressing the most valuable target to get to parity with other modern languages and then will continue to do more.\n\nImportantly, this approach to hardening C++ doesn’t change C++’s value proposition — it keeps C++ still C++, it doesn’t try to turn C++ into “something else” such as by requiring mandatory performance overheads. All of the above embrace C++’s existing source code and its “zero-overhead, don’t pay for it if you don’t use it” core values, and just make it convenient to make memory safety the default — always with an opt-out, so that full performance and control is always available when you want to let Tiamat and Cthulhu use their powers in your service, under your control and for good.\n\nAnd it’s designed to be super adoptable to bring existing code forward:\n\nMany of the improvements are adoptable without any code changes (really!) — just recompile your existing project with a C++26 compiler, and your code will be safer. This is important because when you write code you write bugs, and even when you write code to fix bugs you write new bugs; this is part of the cost of requiring code changes that we’d like to minimize.\n\nEven when you opt into a profile language subset that rejects unsafe code by default, you can still opt back out to writing the unsafe thing with an explicit, greppable, and auditable “suppress safety rule here” annotation (similar to “unsafe” in other languages).\n\nThat’s it — if you stop reading here, you have the full story.\n\nBut I think the details are pretty interesting, so join me if you like as we dive further into the above points (1), (2), and (3)…\n\n(1) Since 2011: constexpr code\n\nStarting in C++11, C++’s compile-time constexpr world has already become a sandbox free from undefined behavior, quietly revolutionizing C++ by enabling powerful compile-time computation while also ensuring safety. During constexpr evaluation, the language mandates well-defined behavior — no wild pointers, no uninitialized reads, no surprises. If an operation might trigger undefined behavior, the compiler simply rejects the constexpr evaluation at compile time. This guarantees correctness before execution time, empowering developers to write faster, safer, and more expressive code.\n\nEvery release of C++ has continued making more of the language and standard library available in compile-time constexpr code, so that as of C++26 nearly the entire language and much of the standard library is available in constexpr code.\n\nThis is modern C++ at its best: unleashing compile-time power while also enforcing its correctness.\n\nThis is in production use, not vaporware: All major compilers have supported UB-free constexpr compile-time code for over a decade and it’s in widespread production use. Probably almost every nontrivial C++ project today is already using at least some UB-free constexpr code, unless it is very old code compiled with a very old compiler.\n\n(2) Since 2024: Language safety and software security improvements adopted for C++26\n\nOver the past year, C++26 has made further solid progress on language safety and software security. Briefly, here’s what C++26 has already adopted (some of this material is repeated from my previous trip reports; see the links for much more detail and discussion):\n\nIn March 2024 (see my March 2024 trip report), draft C++26 eliminated UB for uninitialized variables by turning it instead into a new kind of behavior: erroneous behavior (aka EB) that is still considered “wrong code” (so compilers should still warn about it) but is now well-defined so it is no longer UB-dragon-bait even if your code does transgress. That eliminates one root cause of a serious class of security vulnerabilities.\n\nLast month (see my February 2025 trip report), draft C++26 additionally added a specification for a hardened standard library. Just recompiling with a hardened library gives our programs bounds safety guarantees for many common non-iterator C++26 standard library operations, including common operations on very popular standard types: string, string_view, span, mdspan, vector, array, optional, expected, bitset, and valarray. (At the same meeting, we also adopted language contracts to help improve functional safety for defensive programming to reduce bugs in general.)\n\nImportantly, both of these achieve the holy grail of adoptability: “Just recompile all your existing code with a C++26 compiler / hardened library, and it will be safer.” That’s just an awesome adoption story. If you’ve seen any of my recent talks, you know this is close to my heart… see especially this short clip from my November talk in Poland and also this short clip in the Q&A about the societal value of improving C++. Of course, getting full safety improvements will sometimes require code changes, nobody is saying otherwise — for example, if you write a dangling pointer because your code is confused about ownership then you really will need to go fix and possibly restructure your code. But it’s pretty nice that we can get a subset of the safety improvements even just by recompiling our existing code!\n\nAgain, this is in production use, not vaporware: The support for uninitialized variables and the hardened standard library may be new to draft standard C++26, but they are already well supported on existing compilers. For uninitialized variables, you can already use the pre-standard compiler switches -ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern (GCC, Clang) and /RTC1 (MSVC). For the hardened standard library, as the P3471 authors note, it has already been deployed in major commercial environments (you can use it today in libc++, see documentation here; MS-STL and libstdc++ have some similar options):\n\n“We have experience deploying hardening on Apple platforms in several existing codebases.\n\nGoogle recently published an article where they describe their experience with deploying this very technology to hundreds of millions of lines of code. They reported a performance impact as low as 0.3% and finding over 1000 bugs, including security-critical ones.\n\nGoogle Andromeda published an article ~1 year ago about their successful experience enabling hardening.\n\nThe libc++ maintainers have received numerous informal reports of hardening being turned on and helping find bugs in codebases.\n\nOverall, standard library hardening has been a huge success, in fact we never expected so much success. The reception has been overwhelmingly positive …”\n\nThis really demonstrates the value of addressing low-hanging fruit, and the Pareto principle (aka 80/20 rule): Often 80% of the benefit comes from the first 20% of investment.\n\n(3) Since the past month: More work ongoing in the C++26 timeframe\n\nFor about a year now, multiple C++ committee experts have independently proposed systematically cataloging and/or addressing UB in C++:\n\nDecember 2023: Shafik Yaghmour’s proposal P3075R0 to catalog C++’s language UB and document it as an Annex to the standard. (Building on his earlier pre-pandemic paper P1705R1.) This was encouraged by the core language specification subgroup (aka CWG) at the March 2024 meeting.\n\nOctober 2024: My proposal P3436R0 to catalog UB and systematically address it using the opt-in mechanism of Bjarne Stroustrup and Gabriel Dos Reis’ language profiles proposal which has the ability to designate profiles as “named groups” of related compile-time restrictions and run-time checks that are easy to opt into to make safety the default. For more details, see my November 2024 trip report. This was unanimously encouraged by the Safety and Security subgroup (aka SG23) at the November 2024 meeting.\n\nOctober 2024: Timur Doumler, Gašper Ažman, and Joshua Berne’s proposal P3100R1 to catalog UB and systematically address it as contract violations, using the new C++26 contract_assert feature to perform run time checks also for problematic language features. There is a related proposal P3400 to designate contract labels as “named groups” of related run-time checks that are easy to opt into to make safety the default. P3100 was unanimously encouraged by the Contracts subgroup (aka SG21) at the November 2024 meeting.\n\nYou can see the pattern: there are proposers and volunteers to\n\nsystematically catalog language UB,\n\nspecify a way to eliminate the UB (make it illegal, or well-defined including where necessary with a run-time check such as a bounds check),\n\nmake that elimination happen preferably all the time where it’s efficient enough (as C++26 is doing for uninitialized local variables) or else under a named group that’s easy to opt into (profile name, or contract label name), and\n\nrealizing that different UB cases need to be addressed in different ways, and we’re willing to put in the effort… no magic wand, Just Engineering.\n\nAt our February 2025 meeting, the main subgroup responsible for all language evolution (aka EWG) took these suggestions and gathered them together, and the group approved a mandate to pursue\n\n“… a language safety white paper in the C++26 timeframe containingsystematic treatment of core language Undefined Behavior in C++,covering Erroneous Behavior, Profiles, and Contracts.”\n\nNote that this is separate from C++26, because C++26 is now undergoing feature freeze and will spend the next year doing comment review and fit-and-finish, so we cannot now add new material (such as UB mitigations) to C++26 itself. But we want to keep our momentum and not let this important work wait for C++29, so concurrently with C++26 “in the C++26 timeframe” we intend to work on a white paper to catalog and address C++ language UB, that we hope to publish around the same time as C++26 is published.\n\nNote: A white paper is an ISO publication that’s a flavor of Technical Specification (TS); think of a white paper or TS as a “feature branch.” The C++ committee has already published a dozen TSes since 2012, such as the concepts and modules TSes, most of which have already been merged into the “trunk” international standard (aka IS). A white paper and TS use the same process within the C++ committee, but a white paper just has less ISO red tape at the end compared to a TS so it can be published faster.\n\nSo now and over the next year or two, we’re undertaking to systematically catalog cases of UB in the C++ language to put a visible label on each fang and tentacle. Then, starting with the most important high-value targets, start deciding whether and how to address each in the most appropriate way but likely using those three tools mentioned in the mandate:\n\nC++26 erroneous behavior, which you’ll recall the draft C++26 standard is already using to deal with uninitialized local variables.\n\nBjarne Stroustrup’s profiles and Gabriel Dos Reis’ P3589 profiles framework which allow us to create named groups of rules and checks, so that program code can easily opt into full safety by default and tactically opt out again where needed. Efforts now underway are focusing on implementation and deployment of the profiles framework and a few key profiles for experimentation across the C++ ecosystem.\n\nC++26 contract assertions to check language features, as extended with P3400 labels which allow us to create named groups of checks.\n\nI won’t lie: This is going to be a metric ton of work. And it’s work that I think some people don’t expect C++ to ever be able to do. But I think that it is achievable, and that it will be worth it, and we appreciate and want to thank all the committee members who have already expressed interest in volunteering to help — thank you!\n\nNew a week ago: P3656 strongly encouraged\n\nGašper Ažman and I got appointed to try to organize the work. So to get this started, Gašper and I wrote paper P3656 to detail a proposed procedure and plan. On March 19, EWG reviewed this in a telecon and voted strong encouragement that\n\n“P3656 is ‘on the right track’ with the strategy proposed forproducing a white-paper for ‘Core Language UB (and IF-NDR).’”\n\nSo here’s a quick overview of what we aim to do over the coming year or two, in the same timeframe as C++26…\n\nFirst, list cases: Enumerate language UB\n\nThe goal of this part is to tag every case of language UB directly in the standard’s LaTeX sources, with at least a short description and code example. Using LaTeX tags right in the standard’s sources will let us automatically build another Annex to list the UB in one place, as the standard already does for the grammar for example. Additional detailed discussion and selected mitigations will go into the white paper.\n\nWe will also likely tag some basic attributes of each UB, such as:\n\nhave security experts tag whether it is directly exploitable, so that we can prioritize security-critical low-hanging fruit first; and\n\ntag whether it is cheap to check locally with information already available (such as null pointer dereference which is easy to check locally with ptr != nullptr) or requires more information (such as other-than-null dangling pointer dereference which is more challenging, and some UB may be too expensive to entirely remove).\n\nThis also creates backpressure to reduce adding future UB, by requiring discussion and documentation in this list for any new UB proposals.\n\nSecond, list tools: Create a “non-exhaustive starter menu of tools”\n\nThe idea is to make an initial list of the tool(s) we can apply to each case of UB.\n\nThe EWG mandate already included erroneous behavior (EB), profiles, and contracts as the primary expected tools, so a slightly more detailed candidate list might be:\n\nmake the UB well-defined (just fix it always, no opt-in required; this could be a run-time check);\n\nmake the UB fail to compile (e.g., make it ill-formed which could change the meaning of SFINAE code that could use a different fallback path to avoid the UB path, or make it directly rejected without changing any meaning), either always or when a profile/label is enforced;\n\nmake the UB deprecated, either always or when a profile/label is enforced; and/or\n\nmake the UB be EB instead, either always (as we did for uninitialized locals) or when a profile/label is enforced.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive; we may find UB we want to handle using another technique, but I expect most cases of UB can be handled well using these tools.\n\nWe also intend to write some initial guidelines, for EWG to review and approve, about when to use each tool, including performance considerations, adoption hurdles (like frequency of that UB, or consequences of crashes), and other common considerations.\n\nThird, apply: For each case of UB, say how we plan to address it\n\nIn many cases, this will require thoughtful papers, including strong implementation experience when there is a risk that performance or deployability may be difficult. My expectation is that we will find groups of similar UB that can all be handled in one paper, but the point is we want to be methodical about this… we aim to move fast, but the primary goal here is to make sure we actually unbreak things.\n\nFourth, group: Group UB cases into cohesive groups (profiles names / contract labels)\n\nFinally, we can identify cohesive groups of UB that programs will want to address together, which makes them easy to opt into as a unit; for example, a “bounds_safety” group could include all bounds safety-related UB. These groups can overlap; for example, the same UB fix might be selectable as part of a “bounds_safety” group and as part of a general larger “strict_cplusplus” group.\n\nNew a few days ago: Efforts in progress to lock down the specific UB that malicious code relies on\n\nRelatedly, a very interesting proposal was brought to the February ISO C++ meeting by Úlfar Erlingsson, Google’s DE for Cloud Security, P3627R0 (slides): “Easy-to-adopt security profiles for preventing RCE (remote code execution) in existing C++ code.”\n\nSummarizing Úlfar’s premise:\n\nWe have already developed sufficient hardening implementation technology in modern compilers to effectively harden existing C++ code without code changes — not by aiming for language memory safety guarantees broadly, but by surgically targeting key UB that makes remote code execution (RCE) possible. Specifically: Stack integrity, control-flow integrity (CFI), heap data integrity, and pointer integrity and unforgeability. (Note: Úlfar was the first to efficiently implement stack integrity with strong guarantees, working with George Necula who originally designed it in CCured; and he and collaborators were the first to propose and implement CFI.)\n\nIf we do nothing more than take away the UB that can be used as building blocks for RCE (even if we still allowed other corruption), then bad actors would lose most of the tools they use to gain control over execution and run their malware, and we would dramatically harden the world’s code.\n\nA key problem is that right now these technologies exist as separate features when the real benefit comes from enabling them together, and so we should standardize a profile that lets programmers tell their compilers to activate them together.\n\nOn Thursday, Úlfar published a new paper elaborating these ideas: “How to Secure Existing C and C++ Software without Memory Safety” describes how these techniques could not only prevent most RCE but also generally retake control of execution away from the attackers.\n\nIt’s well worth reading. An updated paper proposing this material for C++ standardization is expected soon in the C++ committee. As Úlfar notes (emphasis added): “This is a big change and will require a team effort: Researchers and standards bodies need to work together to define a set of protection profiles that can be applied to secure existing software — without new risks or difficulties — easily, at the flip of a flag …”\n\nNote: A related new publication updated a week ago is the OpenSSF “Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++.” This is a useful guide to existing security options that are good to know about and can beused in today’s compilers.These options add a variety of warnings and mechanisms that will help with security, including some used inÚlfar’s proposal (CFI and address space layout randomization, aka ASLR). However, these options are all “best effort,” and do not promise any guarantees, even when used all together — including options needing source code changes and those with noticeableoverhead. What makes Úlfar’s approach different is that it carefully selects four specific techniques designed to reinforce each other such that they establish guarantees about the nested execution of functions, and the use of heap objects and pointers. Those guarantees eliminate almost all of the specific UB that malware authors rely on, andwill hold even when the remaining UB is triggered, e.g., to corrupt memory.\n\nIf the language UB white paper could achieve not only its first goal of a broad systematic cataloging and mitigation of UB (grouped into profile/label names that programmers can turn on), but also specifically a “controlled_execution_security” profile that eliminates nearly all remote code execution attacks, that would be a great outcome — and would dramatically reduce C++ software security vulnerability exposure to parity (equality) with the other modern languages.\n\nSummary, and what’s next\n\nAs a wise sage once said: “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”\n\nFor many years, software security may not have seemed pressing enough for C++ standardization broadly to make it a top priority, though gradual improvement has always continually occurred. But times have changed; we have been confronted with a spike of cyberattacks and cyberwar that creates serious threats to the systems we rely on to sustain our civilization, and faced stark choices: react decisively? and how? or not? Making a choice was not optional, as the sage pointed out.\n\nWe have chosen: to focus on improving C++ language safety as a priority, with the goal of achieving parity (as measured in number of security vulnerabilities) with other modern languages.\n\nWe have already accomplished a great deal. Compile-time C++ is already fully free of UB, which means a huge chunk of real-world C++ is already UB-free today. In C++26 we’re already eliminating several frequent vulnerability UB root causes, where in the language uninitialized variables are no longer UB and in the standard library many common operations on widely used types like vector and string and span and string_view are becoming bounds-safe in a C++26 hardened implementation. Although these are new to the standard, all have been deployed at scale in the field, and making them standard will make them easier to adopt even more widely. (In C++26, we are also shipping language contracts for a different aspect of safety, namely functional safety for defensive programming to reduce bugs in general.)\n\nIt’s working: The price of zero-day exploits has already increased. Now we have a path to get the rest of the way to taming UB in C++. Yes, there’s still a great deal of work ahead, but if we can make a solid push over the next one to two years we do have a real shot at systematically addressing UB in C++, including eliminating nearly all remote code execution attacks. If these efforts to cage the monsters works out even half as well as we hope, I think a lot of folks are going to be very (and I think happily) surprised.\n\nAs several other wise sages said: “Let the good times roll.”\n\nIf you’re one of the ones helping with either what’s been accomplished already and/or with our next steps above, we want to again say a big “thank you!” — your help is appreciated, and it really matters.\n\nThanks, very much.\n\nAppendix: UB, briefly\n\nHistorically, UB was allowed in C and then C++ as the basis for compiler optimizations: Compilers are allowed to assume that UB never happens and optimize your program based on that assumption. In the real world, compilers are variously aggressive about making that assumption; for a survey of what common examples the different major compilers actually do optimize in what ways at different optimization levels, see my 2020 paper P2064R0 section 3.4.\n\nWe have now been reconsidering UB for two reasons, which to me corresponds to that the UB dragon has multiple heads:\n\nUB often has directly safety and security implications. For example, if a program sometimes tries to access out-of-bounds memory, a malicious actor can use that vulnerability to write an exploit that will install malware to steal cryptocurrency or worse.\n\nUB also has indirect safety and security implications. For example, if the compiler encounters an if/else branch and notices that one side of the branch would always encounter UB, it can not only assume that branch is never taken, but it can also assume that the condition the branch is testing is always true (or always false) and so not even test it — which is problematic if the branch was doing a deliberately-enabled safety-related contract check that the compiler ends up silently optimizing out of the compiled program so that the check is never performed at all.\n\nUB optimizations also just create mysterious ordinary bugs, such as variables that appear to be simultaneously true and false, unreachable code that gets executed anyway, and “time travel” optimizations that change code that precedes the point where the UB can happen (hence, the idea of UB ‘reaching back to modify the past’).\n\nLess of all those things, please. Over the past decade C++ has been pursuing ways to keep all our glorious optimizations but to specify the optimizability in ways other than fire-breathing mind-flaying UB.\n\nNotes:\n\nAddressing UB in C++ is easier to do than in C, because C is a fine language but is lower-level with fewer standard abstractions, which means it has fewer universally available alternatives to recommend and fewer standard library features that the standard can directly harden.\n\nUB is closely related to another technical concept in the C++ standard called “ill-formed, no diagnostic required” (IF-NDR). For convenience, herein I’m saying just “UB” as a shorthand for “UB and [or, including] IF-NDR.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPublished by Herb Sutter\n\n\t\t\t\tHerb Sutter is an author and speaker, a technical fellow at Citadel Securities, and serves as chair of the ISO C++ standards committee and chair of the Standard C++ Foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Herb Sutter\n\n\t\t\tPublished\n\t\t\t2025-03-302025-03-31",

      "en": "The text discusses ongoing improvements in C++ programming language aimed at enhancing safety and security, particularly by addressing undefined behavior (UB). Key points include:\n\n1. **Focus on Undefined Behavior**: Undefined behavior is a significant issue in C++, leading to memory safety and security vulnerabilities. The community is making efforts to reduce UB, which often leads to exploitable bugs.\n\n2. **Recent and Upcoming Changes in C++26**: \n   - Since C++11, many parts of C++ have become UB-free, especially at compile time with `constexpr` code that guarantees safe execution.\n   - The draft C++26 has removed UB for uninitialized variables and introduced a hardened standard library that enhances safety for common operations.\n   - Future proposals aim to systematically catalog and address UB cases, using tools like erroneous behavior definitions, profiles for safety, and contract assertions.\n\n3. **Adoptability**: Many improvements can be adopted with no code changes; existing code can be recompiled with a C++26 compiler to enhance safety. Developers can still opt out of safety features when needed.\n\n4. **Security Focus**: There is a strong emphasis on addressing UB that could lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. Proposals for security profiles aim to harden existing C++ code without requiring significant modifications.\n\n5. **Community Commitment**: The C++ community is committed to making substantial progress on these issues over the next few years, aiming for a safer and more secure language that can compete with other modern programming languages.\n\nThe text concludes with an optimistic outlook on these efforts, noting the potential for significant improvements in C++ safety and security.",

The building has undergone renovations into a multi-purpose living and working space, dubbed Bell Works by its redevelopers. Since 2013 it has been operated by Somerset Development, who redeveloped the building into a mixed-use office for high-tech startup companies.[11] The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.[9] A number of movies, television programs, and commercials have been filmed at Bell Works, including Severance, The Crowded Room, and Law & Order: Organized Crime.[12]\n\nHistory[edit]\nRadio astronomy[edit]\nBefore the complex was constructed, the site was used by Bell Telephone Laboratories for research. Karl Guthe Jansky invented radio astronomy there, and a monument was placed at the former location (40°21′54.5″N 74°09′48.9″W﻿ / ﻿40.365139°N 74.163583°W﻿ / 40.365139; -74.163583) of the antenna almost seventy years later in 1998. The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky's antenna was at 7:10p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.[13][14]\nIn subsequent years, radio astronomy and similar research was done at the separate Crawford Hill annex facility,[15] some three miles away from the main Holmdel complex.[16]\n\nConstruction and early years[edit]\nA 1995 aerial view of the AT&T Holmdel site\nThe Bells Labs Holmdel building in 2007\nThe transistor water tower in 2016\nIn 1957, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) began to plan a research laboratory in Holmdel Township in Central New Jersey.[7] Constructed between 1959 and 1962, the complex design was one of the final projects of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen before his death in 1961.[6] Used as a research and development complex, it served the needs of the Bell Laboratories division of AT&T.[7] Basic research, applied hardware development, and software development occurred in the building.\nThe building's distinctive features, including its mirror-like appearance, led to recognition as the Laboratory of the Year by R&D in 1967.[17]\nThe building was expanded in 1966 and 1982 to its final size of two million square feet of office and laboratory space.[18] Despite these expansions, the original curtain wall design remained intact, as did the unique layout of the site, which included a large elliptical master plan and country-road like approach. Over its active life-span, the facility and its layout were studied in universities as models of modernist architecture.[19] Internally, the building was divided into four pavilions of labs and offices, each separated from the others by a cross-shaped atrium. The internal pavilions were linked via sky-bridges and perimeter walkway.[7]\nThe water tower on the complex is a three-legged design that reminded people of a transistor. Despite the lack of any documented historical evidence, an urban legend claims that the designer intentionally modelled the tower on the form of a transistor.[20] Another urban legend – less widely circulated than the transistor story – claims that the concrete floodlight stand at the base of the tower was originally a water fountain.[21] The tower was still in usable condition more than 40 years after its construction.[22]\n\nDecline and preservation efforts[edit]\nThe empty building's interior in 2010\nBell Labs subsequently became part of Lucent, and then Alcatel-Lucent.[23]\nIn 2006, Alcatel-Lucent contracted to sell the 2 million-square-foot facility to Preferred Real Estate Investments, during the process of restructuring the company's research efforts.[10] Despite initial plans to maintain the original buildings and keep the six-story complex as a corporate office park, Preferred later sought to rezone it as residential property.[18][21][24][25]\nAs a result, the complex was added to The Cultural Landscape Foundation's list of 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey in May 2007.[1] Additionally, action led to the creation of a citizen's group, Preserving Holmdel, by former Bell employees, to lobby for keeping the complex as it was when in use as a laboratory.[26] A report by Preservation New Jersey contemplated changes to the property, including ideas such as a university center, recreational complex, and a healthcare facility.[27]\nThe transaction with Preferred Real Estate Investments did not close, and on May 17, 2012, Holmdel Township declared the site as an \"Area in Need of Redevelopment\"[28] and adopted a redevelopment plan for the property that included various adaptive reuses of the main building, the construction of up to 40 single-family homes, and 185 age-restricted townhomes outside the main ring road surrounding the building. The plan was based on a concept proposed by Inspired by Somerset Development (then Somerset Development).[29]\nIn September 2013, the property was officially purchased by Inspired by Somerset Development – which submitted a concept plan in accordance with Holmdel Township's redevelopment plan for $27 million.[30] Inspired by Somerset Development proposed an adaptive reuse project that included offices, a health and wellness center, restaurants, shopping, a spa, and a 20,000-square-foot public library. Recreational space and luxury homes were planned for the surrounding land; national homebuilder Toll Brothers was slated to be the residential developer of the project.\nAlexander Gorlin served as the architect for the projects and introduced new designs, which included[31] opening up the laboratory spaces with atrium light by replacing Saarinen's metal panels with glass, redesigning the two mammoth 1,000-by-100-foot atria floors, and replacing skylights with transparent photovoltaic panels. As a result of these design improvements, the building won numerous design and architecture awards, including the Docomomo US Modernism in America Award,[32] Starnet Commercial Flooring Design Award,[33] and the Azure Awards, Architecture Adaptive Re-Use category.[34]\n\nRedevelopment[edit]\nTransition to mixed-use facility[edit]\nBell Labs Holmdel during repurposing to Bell Works in 2016\nIn 2013, Inspired by Somerset Development officially secured ownership of the Bell Labs site and signed a deal with Toll Brothers to sell 103 acres of land to develop 225 homes on a portion of the property between the main building and Crawfords Corner Road while retaining the entirety of the Eero Saarinen-designed structure (Bacevice et al., 2022). This deal with Toll Brothers helped provide the capital for Inspired by Somerset Development to pursue its New Urbanism-inspired redevelopment plan at Bell Labs. The plan aimed to transform the site from office-lab to a space that would provide the Holmdel Township community–and other nearby residents–with access to the benefits traditionally associated with an urban environment (shops, dining, retail, library, offices, etc.) while preserving the structure of an iconic piece of mid-twentieth-century architecture.[35]\nFinding that these redevelopment plans satisfied requirements for residential zoning and preservation standards for the property, Holmdel Township officially approved Somerset Development to move forward with the redevelopment of Bell Labs in August 2013[36] The project was a massive undertaking: The lobby was overgrown with plants and the quarter mile-long roof leaked. Ralph Zucker, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Inspired by Somerset Development, assembled a team of architects, designers, and marketers, including Alexander Gorlin Architects, The Garibaldi Group, Co Op Brand Partners, and NPZ Style + Décor.\nInspired by Somerset Development and the township concluded a lease agreement for $0 to house the Holmdel Township branch of the Monmouth County Library at Bell Works. This represented a significant increase in space for the library, which went from 3,000 square feet to 18,000 square feet.[37]\n\nCurrent use and community impact[edit]\nThe first floor of Bell Works in 2022\nBell Works is often described as a \"metroburb\", a phrase coined by Ralph Zucker, who defined it as a \"an urban hub — a core, a metropolis — in a suburban location.”[38][39] According to Bell Works, a metroburb is “a little metropolis in suburbia… A large-scale mixed-use building, with great access, office, retail, entertainment, hospitality, residential, health, wellness, fitness, everything you would find in a metropolis but in a great suburban location.\"[40] Bell Works’ success as a proof of concept for the metroburb was supported by its new workspace typology, one which used the scale of Bell Works to simulate the density of urban cityscapes within the office while providing a degree of flexibility and modularity that is difficult to achieve outside of a suburban environment.[41] As of 2019, more than 90 percent of the campus’s office space was leased.\nToday, Bell Works’ quarter-mile long atrium has been reimagined into a publicly accessible pedestrian street with shops, restaurants, healthcare, community services, and more.[40] In addition to offering retail and office space, Bell Works hosts conferences and events, including the annual Fourth of July Fireworks.[42] The building, which is open seven days a week, is home to public assets such as the Holmdel Library and Learning Center along with farmers’ markets and holiday celebrations. It also contains a 285-seat theater, opened in 2024 in what was formerly a lecture hall at the laboratory.[43][44]  Bell Theater is curated by the Axelrod Performing Arts Center located in Deal.[45]\nStarting in 2021, the American science fiction psychological thriller television series Severance on Apple TV+ used the Bell Works complex as the fictional headquarters of corporation “Lumon Industries” as portrayed in the show. Most exterior building shots, parking lot shots, and some interior shots of the ground floors and above the building are used in the show.[46]\n\nSee also[edit]\nMid-century modern\nNokia Bell Labs\nReferences[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .reflist{margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%}}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}\n\n^ a b c .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg\")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg\")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain;padding:0 1em 0 0}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:var(--color-error,#d33)}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#085;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}@media screen{.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911f}}Emrich, Ron (August 2008). \"Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, New Jersey\".

      "en": "The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex, located in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, was a significant research facility for 44 years, primarily for Bell System and later for Bell Labs. Designed by architect Eero Saarinen, the complex features a unique mirror-like building that housed over 6,000 engineers and researchers. It is noted for being the site where Nobel Prize-winning work on laser cooling was conducted.\n\nIn 2006, as the company's research focus shifted, the complex was sold and underwent renovations to become a mixed-use space called Bell Works. Since 2013, it has been operated by Somerset Development, catering to high-tech startups and community services, including a library and event spaces. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\n\nHistorically, the location was also significant for the invention of radio astronomy. After its peak, the building faced decline but has now been revived as a vibrant community hub, featuring shops, offices, and public events, while preserving its architectural heritage. Bell Works is often referred to as a \"metroburb,\" blending urban amenities within a suburban setting.",

The dates’ flavor is similar to medjool, semi-dry with honey tones.These unique dates are currently being kept cool in storage. Later this fall, the Arava Institute plans to offer a limited number of dates for sale at the Kibbutz Ketura guesthouse.You can view our live recording of the harvesthere.Hannah wassprouted from a 2,000 year-old seed, and pollinated by another Ancient Judean date tree. Dr. Elaine Solowey, director of the Center for Sustainable Agriculture of the Arava Institute, and Dr. Sarah Sallon, director of the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of Hadassah Hospital, harvested these ancient dates in the culmination of an ambitious, decades-long experiment to raise the biblical-era Phoenix dactylifera – date palm – from the dead.<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35883\" src=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-268x179.jpg\" alt=\"dates on plate in front of tree\" width=\"268\" height=\"179\" srcset=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-268x179.jpg 268w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-632x421.jpg 632w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-768x512.jpg 768w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Methuselah-Dates-Harvest-scaled.jpg 1050w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" />Photo by: Marcos SchonholzDuring Yigal Yadin’s excavations of Masada in the mid 1960’s, ancient date seeds were discovered beneath rubble at the Northern Palace approach. After being kept in storage for over 40 years, a project initiated by Dr. Sallon, aimed to germinate ancient seeds found on archaeological sites in an effort to reintroduce extinct plants previously grown in the region. As part of this endeavor, Dr. Solowey succeeded in germinating one of these ancient date seeds in 2005, initially thought to be botanically impossible. Dubbed Methuselah it was the oldest seed ever grown attracting wide international attention.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Eve-3-268x357.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" />After the successful germination of the first seed, Dr. Solowey and Dr. Sallon took to replicating the experiment. 32 additional intact seeds were chosen, out of which 6 sprouted. The seeds were germinated by warming and hydrating them slowly and gradually. They were then dosed with Gibberellic acid, a growth-promoting plant hormone, and enzymatic fertilizer.In early 2019, three of the six trees named by Dr. Solowey Adam, Jonah and Hannah were moved out of their greenhouse home to be planted outdoors at the Arava Institute’s Daniel Fischel & Sylvia Neil Research & Visitors’ Park.The first tree, Methuselah, was discovered to be male.

Some of the fruit were tasted, and some were sent for further research.The experiment seeks to rediscover the origins of the historic date palm population and confirm the date seeds’ long-term durability, while shedding light on ancient cultivation techniques that nurtured this unique fruit and exploring its potential relevance for modern date agronomy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo read the full paper on Origins and insights into the historic Judean date palm based on genetic analysis of germinated ancient seeds and morphometric studies by Sarah Sallon et al., please refer to Science Advances.Methusaleh and all the ancient date trees can be visited by contacting Keren Kolot.To donate to Dr. Solowey’s ancient dates research project, click here.To read about Dr. Solowey’s work to protect other endangered plant species click here.For more information and/or interview requests, please contact Institute Deputy Director Eliza Mayo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the news\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-34369 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic-157x157.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic-157x157.png 157w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic-300x300.png 300w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic-100x100.png 100w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic-268x268.png 268w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Atlantic.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" />After 2,000 Years, These Seeds Have Finally Sproutedby Sarah Zang – The Atlantic, Feb. 5th, 2020“Their names are Adam, Jonah, Uriel, Boaz, Judith, and Hannah, and their ages are – well, actually, this one’s a bit complicated.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScientists in Israel grow date plants from 2,000-year-old seeds<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-34378 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/guardian-logo-kooth-157x157.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/guardian-logo-kooth-157x157.png 157w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/guardian-logo-kooth-300x300.png 300w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/guardian-logo-kooth-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" />by Nicola David – The Guardian, Feb. 5th, 2020“A handful of date seeds from fruit that ripened around the time of Jesus have been successfully planted and grown in southernIsrael, researchers have revealed.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-34414 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo-157x157.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"157\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo-157x157.jpg 157w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo-100x100.jpg 100w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo-268x268.jpg 268w, https://arava.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/npr-square-logo.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 157px) 100vw, 157px\" />Dates Like Jesus Ate?

So large does the wall loom in the public consciousness that it is often claimed to be visible from space, though in fact it is not. The assertion feels plausible, even intuitive, because of the sheer scale involved: a wall crossing mountains and valleys and desolate uplands. The mind boggles at such an achievement.And yet, it is not alone. In Australia, thousands of miles to the south, there is an equally impressive display of human ingenuity, if not of equal technical mastery. What it lacks in sophistication is more than made up for in extent, however. The Great Wall never fully walled China, but the enormous Dingo Fence guards a full quarter of a continent, running nearly from coast to coast, unbroken through some of the most inhospitable landscapes in the world. Warding off the Australian southeast, this fence begins between the towns of Jandowae and Jimbour in southern Queensland and runs for a total of almost 3,500 miles before it ends off the Eyre Peninsula on the cliffs above the Great Australian Bight.Remarkably, the longest fence in the world was built and is maintained for a single purpose: to protect Australia’s pastoral heartlands from the depredations of a canine. The dingo, the southern continent’s famed (or infamous) wild dog, is a complicated, emotion-stirring animal. A reddish, medium-sized canine with short, smooth fur and a powerful bite, it is the largest predator in the Australian Outback and the only one dangerous to sheep and other livestock. On rare occasions, they have even been known to attack humans.Dingos are referenced variously as a valuable native of the Outback, an invasive species or sometimes little more than a breed of feral dog. Government policy simultaneously lists the dingo as “native wildlife” under the Nature Conservation Act of 1992 and a “restricted invasive animal” under the Biosecurity Act of 2014. The situation, then, is quite hopelessly confused, and a bemused onlooker might reasonably ask: Why?Of all the continents in the world (except Antarctica), Australia is the most ecologically isolated. For 35 million years, it has drifted in the South Seas completely severed from all other landmasses and from nearly all contact with their species. Besides the inevitable bats and seals that swarm the skies and shores of practically every landmass, the only group of mammals ever to reach the continent were a few lineages of small rodents. The result was a fauna both weird and wonderful: giant reptiles, flightless birds and a near-total lack of live-birthing, placental mammals. Until, that is, a certain hairless primate waded ashore about 50,000 years ago.\n\n      “The dingo forces us to question the coherence of ‘nativeness’ as a meaningful concept.”\n\nThe tally of casualties that unfolded over the ensuing millennia was immense. Every single large, terrestrial predator on the continent was wiped out save one: a striped, dog-like marsupial called the thylacine. Alone among Australia’s major carnivores, this species hung on, enduring across the mainland and New Guinea until only around 3,500 years ago.By then, a sea-faring people, the Austronesians, had embarked on their great expansion down through Oceania. It was most likely this culture that brought a certain lineage of primitive dogs who would finally wipe out the thylacine everywhere except Tasmania. The descendants of those ancient dogs would go on to solidify their place on the continent such that by the colonial era, the dingo was the sole apex predator across the Australian Outback.For as long as ecologists and biogeographers have been aware of this complicated history, they have been unsure what to make of it. The ancestors of the dingo may have wiped out the thylacine on the mainland, but they also replaced it; what would remain should they too vanish is an ecological vacuum.Whatever their niche and influence, what’s generally accepted is that the dogs are the descendants of an ancient domestic introduction, which usually earns a species the label “feral”: not truly wild. Peter Menkhorst and Frank Knight’s generally excellent “Field Guide to Mammals of Australia” treats the dingo as a run-of-the-mill non-native species, squeezing it between the entries for invasive cats and foxes and withholding any legitimating conservation status. This is highly relevant, as such a status — “least concerned,” “vulnerable” or “endangered” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List — is only accorded “genuine” species, and the absence of an animal from the Red List is therefore tantamount to a rejection of its independent value. A 2019 IUCN workshop decided to classify the dingo as a “feral domestic” and therefore not a “real” species in its own right.The case of the dingo, then, strikes at the very heart of the ecological conundrum of ecosystem change— of what it means to belong somewhere in nature. Fundamentally, the dingo forces us to question the coherence of “nativeness” as a meaningful concept.The Green Earth TiltsWhat does it mean for a species to be native or not? The seeds of this notion extend far back into history.Grand ecological changes — being slow, laborious processes — are almost always beyond the observational purview of a few generations. Even where certain forms of recollection hark back much further — as with some Aboriginal tribes that seem, remarkably, to preserve memories of ancient, post-glacial floodings — the broader elements of nature tend to be regarded essentially as brute facts: what is, is.In lieu of any cultural understanding of deep time, geological history or evolution, to suppose the essential fixity of nature was once perfectly reasonable in light of the available evidence. In the Western tradition, early Greek philosophy would eventually solidify such primordial presumptions of nature’s fixedness as part of an intricate, more robust cosmological system. The notion of the Great Chain of Being posited a vast sequence of all created things arranged in respect to their descending degrees of perfection. For reasons related to certain intricacies of Aristotelian metaphysics, the Great Chain was necessarily unalterable and the particulars of the natural order therefore made an absolute.This philosophical outlook did unquestionably bring a great number of benefits, the dividends of which we continue to enjoy. The notion of the fixity of nature, of its fundamental coherence and rationality, as inherited from the ancients and refined by the Medieval scholastics, was foundational for the establishment of modern science. Equipped with this faith in the intelligibility and continuity of the created order, the early naturalists set out to explore and catalog every reach of a world ripe for classification. Much knowledge was reaped in this process, but even fertile fields can bring up weeds.The first explorers did not operate within our modern ecological definitions of nativeness and non-nativeness, but circumstances eventually forced them to adapt. The word “native,” deriving from the Latin root nātus or “birth,” originally denoted that which was simply natural or unmodified, uncultivated, undomesticated. In other words: wasteland.It was not always clear to the naturalists whether a given species had originated in the region where it had been documented or whether it might have been brought there by artifice, perhaps even by the very explorers logging the observation. A practice developed of appending an asterisk (*) to signify the listing’s doubtfulness.\n\n      “What does it mean for a species to be native or not?”\n\nMore and more elaborate practices emerged to keep track of the “validity” of such observations, and the initial asterisk gave way to complex definitions and categorizations. Herein lay the germ of the entire modern concept of nativeness: the idea that certain observations documented nature as it should be — in its divinely ordained state — whereas others marked deviations. In any given location, some species belonged and others did not.Eventually, as the subfield of ecology developed to study the dynamics of ecosystems at the landscape scale, the practice of dividing the world into definite species was expanded to the level of ecological communities as well. In his landmark book “Chance and Change: Ecology for Conservationists” (1998), William H. Drury described how many observers “think of the landscape, vegetation and other organisms as an entity that exists over time and takes on its own identity.”All of this matters greatly, for if species exist as totally discrete entities arranged in an absolute, preordained pattern, and if the ecological communities they exist within likewise consist of static systems, then no room whatsoever is left for the movement of populations, nor for the establishment of new arrivals. It would mean that nature is essentially set, and any change from the original baseline (whatever that may be) would only ever be deleterious. This general conception, this hunch that there is a specific way nature ought to be and from which our actions cause it to deviate, has persisted long after the abandonment of the Great Chain of Being and the cosmology it entails.The modern view of ecological communities as static, perpetually self-maintaining systems is directly traceable back to that idea: Nature is fundamentally unalterable if it is to remain known as “nature” at all. To be “native” is to occupy one’s proper place in a grand, unalterable pattern, and those populations that do not conform — say, a certain breed of wild dogs in the Outback of Australia — therefore have no claim to ecological authenticity or, it follows, protection.There are countless other cases like the dingo: vagrants, castaways and loiterers far outside their “proper” homelands. Some may be detectable from their deleterious ecological impacts — invasives in the proper sense — but a legion of others are more difficult to separate from the landscapes they now exist in.\n\n            Read Noema in print.\n\n        Indeed, biologists even introduced the term “archaeophyte” to denote a plant introduced so far in the ancient past that its status as non-native has been totally eclipsed by eons of time. Examples abound, including such hallmarks of the English countryside as corncockle, mugwort and even the emblematic field poppy. No equivalent term exists for animals, but there are many of them as well: the dingo, of course, but also rabbits in England, red deer in Ireland, mouflons (wild sheep) in Cyprus, cuscuses (a kind of marsupial) in insular Melanesia. All of these were introduced millennia ago — in the case of the cuscuses, apparently before 20,000 B.C.E. The Cyprus mouflon is recognized as its own subspecies, Ovis orientalis ophion, despite being the descendant of ancient domestic sheep. It is notable that this exact same origin disqualified the dingo from serious recognition.\n\n      “Nativity and non-nativity are ultimately concepts circumscribed by human definitions.”\n\nIndeed, the claim has been made that the dingo, whatever its origins, is now a fully wild animal, enmeshed in its ecosystem — and it cannot, therefore, be equated with domestic livestock or be condemned as a mere escaped dog. So the argument goes. This, however, is exactly the difficulty: The status “feral” almost by definition means it cannot be outgrown. Wildness and domesticity constitute a sharp, ontological binary, and the state of “feral-ness” is a catch-all label for any member of the latter group caught attempting to escape — quite hopelessly — the original sin of human companionship. The Midas touch of our species, whose brush invariably transmutes nature into artifice, can take lineages out of the wild, but it cannot put them back. Once a domestic, always a domestic. There is no requiem for the stray dog.The problem deepens very quickly: Beyond the cases of assisted movements, recent or ancient, there is also the number of apparently un-assisted, purely “natural” migrations that have occurred in historic times. When human pressures caused the populations of New Zealand fairy penguins, Eudyptula minor, to decline during the colonial era, its Australian relative, E. novaehollandiae, took over the region around Otago. Today, both species coexist in different parts of South Island. The question presents itself: Which is the “valid” population? Are the interloping Australians obstructing their “more native” cousins from retaking their former range, or does their unassisted arrival validate their presence?Similarly, consider the cattle egret, which has been rapidly spreading across the Americas since arriving from the Old World around the 1870s, seemingly by its own volition yet in response to favorable conditions created by humans. Is that a natural or artificial migration?Such populations are at times termed “neo-native” to acknowledge the inherent dynamism of species ranges, yet the difficulty does not end there, for such unassisted-yet-facilitated movements are not merely a feature of the present and future but of the past as well. Even so archetypal an animal as the moose, an icon of Canada and the great northwest, appears to have only arrived in North America at the end of the last ice age, entering an ecological vacuum created when early humans wiped out the related “stag-moose,” Cervalces scotti.To be forced to conclude that the moose, of all animals, is in some sense non-native to Canada and Alaska seems almost a perfect reductio ad absurdum of the entire concept of stringent indigeneity. Nativity and non-nativity are ultimately concepts circumscribed by human definitions, while the difference between non– and neo-nativity is a judgment entirely divorced from actual ecological impacts. On a tilting, moving planet of porous boundaries, things change, species shift and our definitions, surely, must be able to accommodate this reality. All the same, to completely reject the categories of nativeness and non-nativity seems perilously close to an invitation to ecological anarchy. Perhaps there is another way.Order In A Shifting WorldAs Drury wrote, referencing the thought of Aristotle: “If one starts with false premises, dialogue and logic will not necessarily lead one to the right conclusions.” Disturbance and disruption, viewed through the lens of an essentially fixed, inflexible natural world, are scarcely distinguishable from “damage.” If the cause of such disruption is a native species, it must be overpopulated and therefore eligible for “control.” If the cause is a foreign arrival, its impact is the clinching proof of its malignancy.Rarely asked is whether chaos and dynamism might actually have a place in the aboriginal state of an ecosystem. Might the recent, historically observed inertness itself be the anomaly, brought about by the neutering of wild potencies? And most importantly, does the political and conservation discourse regarding “natives” and “invasives” adequately distinguish between concerns that are fundamentally aesthetic versus those that are ecological?Consider the dingo: Whether it is the descendant of an ancient wild canine or a partially domesticated offshoot thereof, is, from an ecosystem perspective, utterly irrelevant. Whether the ancestors of the dingo went straight from the teak and laurel forests of Asia to the eucalyptus woods of Australia, or whether they spent some interim period loitering about the edges of human camps, has not the slightest bearing on its current, measurable ecological impact. Nor, in either case, does it render the dingo, as a canid on a formerly canid-less continent, the least bit more or less foreign to its broader environment.The sole place the classification of the dingo matters — yet here it matters immensely — is in the minds of Australian government officials and the conservationists they consult. For them, the matter at stake is nothing less than whether to regard the animal as a genuine, valid species with its own, intrinsic value — or as a mere stray dog, not even a real species in its own right.Drury responded to the great variance and mutability of nature, and the lack of workable definitions in his day, by rejecting the fundamental meaningfulness of “ecological communities” as a concept: Communities, he concluded, are merely interpretive frames we impose upon the clutter of the natural world as aids for communication and understanding. In this, he is essentially a sort of “ecological conceptualist.” This would, indeed, resolve the questions, if not the actual practical issues, surrounding nativeness in species: Nothing is really native, for there are ultimately no real communities to be native to.\n\n      “On a tilting, moving planet of porous boundaries, things change, species shift and our definitions, surely, must be able to accommodate this reality.”\n\nPerhaps we need not go quite so far. As discrete assemblages of particular species, communities are not entirely self-organizing or enduring, as Drury rightly notes. Those assemblages of organisms that we chance to find associated with each other in nature are frequently the result of a great deal of happenstance and contingency. Should one take a time machine 3,000 years into the future or the past, the composition of trees in a given forest would likely look very different.There is, however, a difference between communities and ecosystems. The validity of the latter as genuine natural phenomena seems salvageable if conceived of correctly.The concept of the functional trait is useful here. Per one definition, a functional trait is “a well-defined, measurable property of organisms, usually measured at the individual level and used comparatively across species,” which, per a second definition, may be “morphological, biochemical, physiological, structural, phenological or behavioural characteristics … that influence performance or fitness.”Traits determine the influence of the trait-holders on their environment, as well as their varying abilities to respond to it. Examples might include anything from plants’ seed dispersal capacity, palatability, growth rates, size and so on. In animals, they modulate grazing, hunting and all other forms of behavior. Recent science has shown that functional diversity and differences in key traits between introduced and recipient plant communities provide the best descriptor of invasive plant success. Even more significantly, a 2024 paper demonstrated that it was traits, and not (pre)historical nativeness, that shaped the ecological effects of large mammalian herbivores.Stressed sufficiently, the dominance of such traits over trait carriers becomes self-evident: A given prey species does not care about the genome or morphology of its primary predator, save to the degree that these things influence its behavior — that is to say, to the degree that they modulate traits. Should an entirely unrelated species possess the same predatory capacities and proclivities, the difference in phylogeny would be rather unimportant to an antelope about to be eaten. That we cannot, nevertheless, discount the trait-bearers and the species-level view from ecological considerations is because all creatures carry not one or two or even a handful of ecological traits, but dozens if not hundreds.Traits — size, diet, metabolism, reproductive rates — come bundled, and it is therefore exceedingly rare to find two species that are, in fact, exactly one-to-one equivalent. A water buffalo and an extinct marsupial may be essentially comparable regarding some of their ecological traits, including, perhaps, the most decisive ones, but they will invariably differ in others. The decisive question, then, is what degree of similarity may suffice. The dingo is not a thylacine; its ecological effects do not correspond exactly. Neither would those of leopards or tigers to the extinct marsupial lions, nor even of the Komodo dragons to their vanished Aussie relatives. Is it, however, “more unnatural” to have the “wrong” Australian top predators, or to have no top predators at all?\n\n      “An ecosystem is more than the sum of its parts. It is an emergent system whose stability inheres in the various roles its constituent species fill.”\n\nOnce integrated, these concepts may provide a flexible, workable basis for thinking of natural systems. Forgive the rather dry summation: Ecosystems are self-ordering constellations of trait interactions transcending the particular species that make them up and contingent on the physio-chemical factors that constrain them. In other words, an ecosystem is more than the sum of its parts. It is an emergent system whose stability inheres in the various roles its constituent species fill.Individual species may be replaced or simply lost, but so long as the keystone traits, and the interactions between them, remain in place, the ecosystem may endure in something like “homeostasis.” It is the trait, not the trait carrier, that is fundamentally native to the system. Nativity at the species level, then, is perhaps best understood as the state of integration into a preexisting, superordinate web of interrelated roles and functions.The ancient Greeks wrote and sang much on the theme of νόστος or “homecoming.” In our time we ought, perhaps, to reflect on the concept of becoming at home. None would think to deny today’s Māori their nativeness to New Zealand, yet in the days of Kupe’s great canoes when their ancestors drew ashore, they were new to the land.Nativeness in human societies is a topic and a quandary of its own, yet the conceptual overlap is inescapable. Belonging, home and fittedness to place — these are not concepts we can eschew altogether without throwing the world, and our understanding of it, into jeopardy. Clearly, the association of the giant panda with China and the kiwi with New Zealand is not merely a matter of arbitrary perceptions. Yet neither can we fence out all the dingos and their likes, nor insist upon criteria for nature more static than the natural world itself.Ecological systems, and the associations that constitute them, are real and crucial. It is only that we cannot, in our shifting, changing world, be rigid to the point of blindness, lest we lose our grasp on the very things we are trying to preserve.\n\n            Enjoy the read?

      "en": "The article discusses the complex history of dingoes in Australia and raises questions about the concept of \"nativeness\" in species. \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Dingo Fence**: The Dingo Fence is one of the longest fences in the world, built to protect agricultural land from dingoes, which are wild dogs and apex predators in the Australian Outback.\n\n2. **Conflicting Status**: Dingoes are classified both as native wildlife and as invasive species by different laws, leading to confusion about their ecological role and conservation status.\n\n3. **Ecological Isolation**: Australia has been ecologically isolated for millions of years, leading to a unique array of wildlife, but this changed when humans arrived, bringing with them dingoes, which then became the main predator in the ecosystem.\n\n4. **Questioning Nativeness**: The case of the dingo challenges traditional notions of what it means to be \"native\" as it has origins linked to early human migration. It prompts a reevaluation of how species are categorized based on their origins versus their ecological roles.\n\n5. **Dynamic Ecosystems**: The article suggests that ecosystems are dynamic and not rigidly defined by the presence or absence of certain species. It emphasizes the importance of functional traits over strict definitions of nativeness.\n\n6. **Need for Flexibility**: The author argues for a flexible understanding of ecological systems that accommodates changes and new species, rather than adhering to outdated concepts of fixed nativeness.\n\nIn summary, the dingo's presence in Australia complicates our understanding of what it means for a species to be considered native and highlights the need for a more adaptable approach to ecological conservation.",

The condition is more common in women than in men, and there's evidence that female sex hormones, such as progesterone, can exacerbate patients' symptoms.The exact prevalence of TMAU is unknown, and estimates of global cases vary greatly, ranging from 1 in a million to 1 in 200,000 people.Causes: Patients with TMAU smell like fish due to a buildup of a chemical called trimethylamine in their body. Trimethylamine is produced by bacteria in the gut as a byproduct of the digestion of certain foods, including eggs, liver, legumes and specific kinds of seafood, such as fish, squid and crabs.Related: Why can't we smell ourselves as well as we smell others?Normally, an enzyme in the body breaks down trimethylamine into an odorless chemical, known as trimethylamine N-oxide, which is then excreted via urine. This enzyme is encoded by a gene called FMO3.In patients with TMAU, though, this enzymatic process doesn't occur, so trimethylamine accumulates in the body and ends up being released in excess quantities in patients' sweat, urine and breath. This makes them smell like rotten fish.\n    window.sliceComponents = window.sliceComponents || {};\n\n    externalsScriptLoaded.then(() => {\n        window.reliablePageLoad.then(() => {\n            var componentContainer = document.querySelector(\"#slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-i4QKKh6CBqnWmRAKsKPEZA\");\n\n            if (componentContainer) {\n                var data = {\"layout\":\"inbodyContent\",\"header\":\"Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\",\"tagline\":\"Get the world\\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\",\"formFooterText\":\"By submitting your information you agree to the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/futureplc.com\\/terms-conditions\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Terms & Conditions<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/futureplc.com\\/privacy-policy\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Privacy Policy<\\/a> and are aged 16 or over.\",\"successMessage\":{\"body\":\"Thank you for signing up.

In these instances, patients inherit the disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning they must inherit two copies of the mutated FMO3 gene — one from each parent — to develop the condition.More rarely, TMAU can be caused by consuming a large quantity of foods that lead to trimethylamine production. It can also result from liver failure and certain medical treatments, such as testosterone replacement therapy, which impact the processing and production of trimethylamine, respectively. Hormonal changes brought about by the menstrual cycle can also cause a transient form of TMAU.Patients with trimethylaminuria should avoid eating seafood, which can aggravate their symptoms. (Image credit: Oscar Wong via Getty Images)Symptoms: Symptoms of TMAU may be present from birth or arise later in life, normally near the start of puberty (roughly around age 8 to 13 in females and 9 to 14 in males), when many hormonal changes happen.Some patients with TMAU have a strong fishy odor all the time, while the smell may come and go for others with the condition. A patient's stress levels and diet can worsen their symptoms by increasing their sweat production and levels of trimethylamine, respectively.TMAU is not deadly, but the condition can have devastating effects on patients' quality of life, by impeding their relationships with others and their career, for instance. These impacts can considerably impede their mental health and may lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in some.Treatments: There is no cure for TMAU. However, health care providers may recommend that patients avoid foods that contain trimethylamine or substances that can be broken down into the chemical. These include milk from wheat-fed cows, as well as eggs, liver, kidney, seafood and peas.OTHER RARE DISEASES—What is babesiosis?

They may also be advised to take measures to reduce their stress levels.Additionally, doctors can prescribe low doses of antibiotics to reduce the amount of bacteria in the gut that metabolize trimethylamine. They may also prescribe activated charcoal, which binds to and reduces the amount of trimethylamine that can be absorbed from the gut. (Activated charcoal can interact with many medications, though, so it should be used with caution.)DisclaimerThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\n\nTOPICS\n\nrare diseases\n\nEmily CookeSocial Links NavigationStaff WriterEmily is a health news writer based in London, United Kingdom.

Normally, an enzyme called FMO3 breaks down trimethylamine, but in people with TMAU, this enzyme is not functional, leading to the accumulation of the odor.\n\nTMAU is more prevalent in women and can be triggered by hormonal changes, particularly during puberty. Symptoms can appear at birth or later in life, and while the condition is not life-threatening, it can severely impact mental health and social interactions.\n\nThere is no cure for TMAU, but management strategies include avoiding foods rich in trimethylamine (like seafood, eggs, and certain meats), using acidic soaps, and taking medications like antibiotics or activated charcoal to reduce trimethylamine levels.",

    "content": "Eco Cycles or How I Feel About Technology\n    28 March 2025\n\n    Umberto Eco, the author of The Name of the Rose and Foucault’s Pendulum (my personal favorite), wasn’t just a brilliant scholar—he was also a bit of a geek. He once wrote an essay comparing Macs to Catholicism and PCs to Protestantism. He thought about technology a lot.\nAnd he loved his fax machine. The ability to send manuscripts to his editor in minutes felt magical. At first.\nBut the magic didn’t last. Too many people had his number. The machine started spitting out unsolicited ads, junk, spam. Eventually, he just turned it off. What began as a miracle of speed became a firehose of noise.\nThat story isn’t unique to fax machines. It’s a familiar arc—one we’ve all lived through in different forms.\nThe Eco Cycle\nEvery major technology arrives with a promise, and for a while, it delivers. Early adopters ride the wave before anyone else even sees it coming. Imagine driving a car on an empty highway, going wherever you want. Or using the internet in the early 2000s—when it was chaotic, creative, and weird in the best way. If you were there, it felt like a revolution.\nBut then the crash comes.\nHighways clog up. The internet becomes an ad engine. The comment section is a bloodbath, and you're constantly dodging phishing emails.\nI call it the Eco Cycle: the lifecycle of a technology that starts as a powerful edge for early adopters and gradually decays into dysfunction as it goes mainstream.\nThe decay is slow. You don’t wake up one morning and realize the tool has turned on you. It happens drip by drip, feature by feature, until one day you’re not excited anymore—you’re just managing. You’re maintaining.\nAnd by the time you see it, the system has already reshaped your habits, your expectations, your sense of what’s normal.\nTechnologies That Rode the Curve\nEmail was a breakthrough. It had the same kind of magic Eco experienced with his fax machine decades earlier. But the magic faded. The problem wasn’t just spam—it was volume. Faxes had friction. Email doesn’t. And when communication becomes nearly free, the floodgates open: low-effort check-ins, reply-all storms, endless CCs.\nAnd email is just one tab. Now we juggle Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, DMs, Discord, LinkedIn messages, calendar invites, and comment threads. Communication didn’t scale insight—it scaled interruption.\nResearchers at UC Irvine found that reducing email access lowers stress and improves focus. Other studies show that communication overload reduces cognitive performance—like missing a night of sleep. The effect is real, and measurable.\nEmail was a symbol of freedom—the ability to talk to anyone, anytime, from anywhere. It promised liberation from gatekeepers, postage, and distance.\nCars made the same promise fifty years ago. If you had one, you could go wherever you wanted, whenever you wanted. Mobility, autonomy, speed.\nBut the promise didn’t scale. Everyone got a car, and now we sit in traffic. Everyone got email, and now we drown in messages. The thing that once set you free becomes the thing you have to manage—not because it failed, but because it worked too well, for too many people, all at once.\nSmartphones were supposed to keep us connected. Now they fragment our attention, mine our behavior, and demand our eyes every waking hour.\nFertilizers boosted crop yields, then wrecked the soil and poisoned the water. Antibiotics saved lives, then gave rise to drug-resistant superbugs. Cheap flights opened the world—and turned the most beautiful places into theme parks.\nThe pattern is always the same: what begins as a breakthrough becomes, with scale, a burden.\nWhy We’ll Never Solve Traffic Jams\nI can't quite pinpoint the emotion I feel whenever I hear someone talk about solving traffic jams. My therapist thinks it’s because I’m generally not good at naming feelings, so there’s definitely work to do here. Anyhow, it's a strange cocktail: a mix of surprise, annoyance, disapproval of how tax money gets spent, disdain for meaningless conversations. There's quite a bit of ego—\"I know better.\" But I’m working on it.\nThe thing is, we’ve tried. For decades. Bigger roads, smarter routing, new bypasses. And still, people sit in traffic for hours.\nBecause traffic isn’t a logistics problem. It’s a psychological one.\nWe had traffic jams with horses and carts. Then with Model Ts. Now with Teslas. We’ll have them with flying cars, or whatever Elon is cooking up next. Doesn’t matter.\nWhen I lived in San Francisco, I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that one of my coworkers spent four hours a day commuting. Four. Hours. And he didn’t mind. That’s the point. His tolerance for sitting in traffic was high enough that it was just… normal.\nGive that same person a faster car, a smarter road, a flying drone-pod, and they won’t commute for less time. They’ll just live farther out. The metro stretches. The problem scales.\nThat’s why traffic never goes away. It’s not a bug. It’s baked into us.\nThe Hedonic Treadmill of Technology\nTech doesn’t just solve problems—it feeds desires. Often ones we didn’t even know we had. You get what you want, you adjust, and then you want more. This is what psychologists call the hedonic treadmill: the idea that satisfaction is always temporary, and progress just resets our baseline for what feels normal.\nYou’ve seen it in horror movies: a creature that reads your mind and becomes your worst fear. But now flip it. Imagine a system that reads your mind and becomes the one thing you crave most. Irresistible. Always updating. Always one step ahead of your boredom. It doesn’t haunt you—it seduces you.\nThat’s the algorithm. That’s the feed. That’s the infinite scroll.\nComputers were once marketed as bicycles for the mind. Now they’re escalators to hell—you can’t steer, you can’t get off, and every few steps there’s another promise of freedom, if you just click, scroll, or buy one more thing.\nThe craving creates the system, and the system amplifies the craving. That’s the loop. That’s the treadmill. And it’s picking up speed.\nHidden in Plain Sight\nAll of this—the craving, the overload, the feeling of never being done—none of it is new. The patterns might look modern, but the root cause is ancient: we want too much, and we don’t know how to stop wanting.\nBuddhism calls it tanha, or thirst. The more you feed it, the more it grows. Christianity, Islam, Stoicism—they all say the same thing in different languages: unchecked desire will own you. Mephistopheles doesn’t force Faust into submission—he tempts him. The deal is always the same: power now, for a price you’ll only understand later. It’s the oldest scam in the book. And we fall for it every time.\nThere’s a joke about a startup founder who gets approached by the devil. The devil offers him a funding round in exchange for his soul. They haggle. Settle on a number. The devil walks away, satisfied. And the founder mutters, “I feel like he's taking advantage of me… but I don’t see how.”\nThat’s the game. And everyone plays it.\nTechnology just happens to be the newest delivery system.\nAnd perhaps most revealing: it's the people closest to the technology—the ones who build it, fund it, and evangelize it—who seem to understand best that it's a trap. Steve Jobs once admitted that his kids weren’t allowed to use the iPad. Not even the product he helped create was welcome in his own home. The Waldorf School of the Peninsula—located minutes from some of Silicon Valley’s biggest tech campuses, where kids of the most prominent tech executives go—bans smartphones, promotes hands-on play, and delays screen use until high school.\nThis isn’t nostalgia. It’s a counterweight. A rebellion against tools that were supposed to empower us but now demand we check in, scroll, and optimize ourselves into exhaustion.\nSo if the old wisdom already warned us, how did we end up here anyway?\nSelfish Tech: What Technology Wants\nRichard Dawkins gave us the selfish gene—the idea that genes behave in ways that ensure their own survival, even if it comes at the organism’s expense. Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired, extended that logic to machines. In What Technology Wants, he argued that technology evolves like a living system. It doesn’t just follow our wants—it develops its own.\nIt wants growth. Spread. Replication.\nEvery platform, every tool, every new interface is built to propagate itself. Your phone wants to be used. Your feed wants to be scrolled. Your inbox wants to stay full. It’s not personal—it’s just how systems work once they start selecting for attention.\nTechnology doesn’t care if you’re fulfilled. It only needs you to engage long enough to pass itself on. And so we become the carriers—living vessels for its expansion. We optimize, automate, post, click, and scroll, not for ourselves, but for the system.\nAnd we feel it. The stress, the emptiness, the creeping sense that we’re constantly connected and somehow still not whole. There's a reason depression and anxiety are skyrocketing. Because when you're tricked—like a child—into doing work for something you don’t understand, that doesn’t serve you, that doesn’t love you back, it leaves a mark.\nWhen you're living for something that isn't truly yours, you can’t feel free. You can only feel used.\nReal Freedom\nTechnology gives us options. It moves fast. It feels powerful. But most of the time, it doesn't make us free. It just makes us more efficient at staying trapped.\nReal freedom isn't something you download. It's not in a new workflow or a smarter app. It's in knowing what to say no to. It's in choosing which cycles to exit—and which ones not to enter at all.\nThe Eco Cycle isn’t just about technology. It’s about us. Our habits. Our hunger. Our inability to stop chasing the next thing that promises control, speed, leverage, status.\nYou don’t win by keeping up. You win by stepping out.",

      "en": "**Summary of \"Eco Cycles or How I Feel About Technology\"**\n\nUmberto Eco, a renowned author and thinker, had a complex relationship with technology. He initially marveled at innovations like fax machines but later became overwhelmed by the spam they produced. This experience reflects a common pattern he describes as the \"Eco Cycle,\" where new technologies start as exciting and beneficial for early adopters but eventually become burdensome and dysfunctional as they go mainstream.\n\nThe Eco Cycle illustrates how technologies like email and smartphones, which once promised freedom and efficiency, can lead to information overload and distraction. As more people adopt these technologies, they become less effective and more demanding, turning from tools of liberation into sources of stress.\n\nTraffic jams exemplify this cycle; they are less about logistics and more about human psychology. Despite improvements in transportation, people adapt by living farther away, maintaining the problem.\n\nEco explores the concept of the \"hedonic treadmill,\" where satisfaction from technology is temporary, leading to a constant desire for more. This cycle of craving and consumption is rooted in human nature, as seen across various cultures and philosophies.\n\nHe argues that technology often prioritizes its own growth over our well-being. As we engage with these systems, we may feel more stressed and unfulfilled. Real freedom comes not from embracing every new technology but from knowing when to say no and choosing which cycles to exit. Ultimately, the Eco Cycle reflects our habits and desires, emphasizing the importance of stepping back rather than just keeping up.",

    "content": "Dec 14\n\n        Dec 14 Don't write clean code, write CRISP code\n\n          John Arundel\n\nI’m sure we’re all in favour of “clean code”, but it’s one of those\nmotherhood-and-apple-pie things that no one can reasonably disagree\nwith. Who wants to write dirty code, unless maybe it’s for a\nporn site?\nThe problem, of course, is that few of us can agree on what “clean\ncode” means, and how to get there. A rule like “methods should\nonly do one thing”, looks great on a T-shirt, but it’s not so easy to\napply in practice. What counts as “one thing”?\nOver a lifetime of programming that began with a ZX81 and hasn’t\nquite ended yet, I’ve found a few principles enduringly useful.\nPrinciples are more flexible than rules, and might be more widely\napplicable. So here are my five rules for CRISP code in Go: they’re not\nnecessarily in order of importance, except for the first one, but it\nmakes a nice backronym.\nCorrect\nYour code may have lots of other wonderful things to be said for it,\nbut if it’s not correct, they don’t really matter. And, indeed,\nif we’re willing to give up correctness, we can presumably obtain any\nother attribute fairly easily.\nIt might seem obvious and not worth saying, but if incorrect code\nexists, and I think it does, then surely it is worth saying,\nbecause apparently someone didn’t get the memo.\nWhat does it mean for code to be correct, actually? The\nstraightforward answer is “it does what the writer intended”, but even\nthat’s not quite right, because I might have intended the wrong\nthing!\nFor example, I might write a prime number generator while labouring\nunder the erroneous impression that all odd numbers are prime. In this\ncase, my code might produce the odd integers, as I requested, but still\nnot be correct.\nA good suite of tests, again like\napple pie, is something just about everyone would love to have, even if\nthey don’t always feel like putting in the necessary labour. And tests\nare a necessary, though not sufficient, part of any good program. No\ndoubt there are some correct programs that don’t have tests, but who\nknows which ones they are?\nA well-written test expresses what the\nprogrammer thinks the code should do under a given set of\ncircumstances, and running it should give us a certain level of\nconfidence about whether it actually does or not. Tests themselves can\nbe incorrect, though.\nThis is one reason why we need to be very suspicious and sceptical of\nany given test. What does it look like it says? Does it\nactually say that? Is it the right thing to say? If it verifies\nthe program’s result against some expected result, is the\nexpectation correct?\nIf the test claims to cover some particular section of code, does it\nactually test the behaviour of that code in all important ways,\nor does it merely cause it to be executed?\nNot having tests is a terrible situation to be in, but it’s actually\nslightly preferable to having tests that don’t work. A malfunctioning or\ninsufficient test may give us false confidence in code that also happens\nto be incorrect.\nTherefore, once you’ve written your tests, read them all again\nextremely carefully, with an adversarial eye. Programmers are incurable\noptimists: we always think our code will work, despite much evidence to\nthe contrary. Instead, we should assume that if there can be a\nbug, then there is a bug. Humility isn’t a virtue often associated\nwith software engineers, but it’s certainly something that good test\nwriters know all about.\nEven the most thoroughly tested code should not be assumed to be\ncorrect. It should be assumed to be incorrect. It almost certainly\nis.\nReadable\nAgain, this might sound like something that doesn’t need saying:\nwho’s arguing for unreadable code? Not me, but there seems to\nbe a lot of it around, all the same. It’s not that anyone deliberately\nsets out to write unreadable code, of course; it just ends up that way\nbecause we mistakenly prioritise other virtues over readability.\nPerformance is one such virtue, and there are cases where performance\ngenuinely matters. Not as many as you might\nthink, though: computers are pretty fast these days, and since most\nof what they do is in the service of us humans, they can usually afford\nto take their time about it.\nSo, while readability isn’t quite as important as\ncorrectness, it’s more important than anything else. Readability, as\nChurchill said of courage, is rightly esteemed the first of qualities,\nbecause it is the quality which guarantees all others.\nWhat is it that makes code readable, or not? I don’t think\nreadability is something that you can add to your code: I think\nit’s what you’re left with when you’ve taken away all the\nthings that make it hard to understand.\nFor example, a poorly-chosen variable name can put a bump in the\nreader’s path. Using different names for the same thing, or the same\nname for different things, is confusing. An unnecessary function call,\nadded purely to satisfy some rule like\n“methods should be less than 10 lines”, breaks the reader’s flow.\nIt’s like reading an article and coming across an unfamiliar word:\nshould you pause to look it up, and risk losing the train of thought, or\nstruggle on and try to infer the meaning from context?\nThe best way to make any code more readable is, oddly enough, to\nstart by reading it. But I mean something\nspecial by that. I don’t mean scrolling hurriedly through pages and\npages of code, glancing and skimming to get a sense of what’s happening.\nThat is a useful skill, but for other tasks.\nInstead, we need to read code in a careful, sequential,\nintentional way. We need to begin at the beginning, and go on\ntill we come to the end. If it’s not clear where the program\nbegins, then that’s the first thing we need to fix.\nAs we follow the thread of execution of the program, we need to read\neach line carefully and then try to answer two questions about it:\n\nWhat does it say?\nWhat does it mean?\n\nFor example, consider the following line:\nrequests++\nWhat it says is clear: it increases the value of some\nnumeric variable requests by one. What’s not so easy to\nwork out is what that means. What is being counted in the\nrequests variable? Why is it being incremented? What\nsignificance does that have? Where did requests get its\ncurrent value? What is its current value? When and where will\nthat value be checked? Is there some maximum value? What\nhappens when we reach it? And so on.\nThere may be perfectly good answers to all these questions, but\nthat’s not the point. The point is, can the reader answer them\njust by looking at the code? If not, what can we do to provide the\nanswers, or make them easier to find? By reading our own code as though\nwe were new to it, we see it with fresh eyes and discover the parts that\nneed more cognitive effort to follow.\nIdiomatic\nI don’t think this is quite the right word: I’d prefer\n“conventional”, but again that doesn’t fit with the CRISP\nbackronym. Still, when people say “such and such is idiomatic”, what\nthey really mean is “this is the conventional way to do it.”\nConventions are useful: there are\nlots of possible ways to lay out the controls for a car, for example,\nand the one we’re used to isn’t demonstrably optimal. We’re just used to\nit. There’s no law stopping a car manufacturer from putting the pedals\nin a different arrangement, but they don’t. Even if there were some\ndemonstrable benefit, it wouldn’t be worth the cognitive cost to users:\ngetting confused between the accelerator and brake pedal would be\nunfortunate.\nSimilarly, I think there’s great value in using conventional\nnames for things: in an HTTP handler, the request pointer is\nalways called r and the response writer w. If\nthere’s a universal convention, it’s worth following. You’ll also have\nlocal and personal conventions. In my code, an arbitrary\nbytes.Buffer is always named buf, the compared\nvalues in my tests are always named want and\ngot, and so on.\nAn obvious example of a universal convention is err: Go\nprogrammers always use this name to refer to an arbitrary error value. While we wouldn’t usually\nre-use variable names within the same function, we do re-use\nerr for all the various errors that there can be throughout\nthe function. It’s a mistake to try to avoid this by creating variant\nnames like err2, err3, and so on.\nWhy? Because it requires a tiny bit more cognitive effort from the\nreader. If you see err, your mind glides right over it with\nperfect understanding. If you see some other name, your mind has to stop\nto resolve the puzzle.\nI call these tiny roadblocks “cognitive microaggressions”. Each is so\ntiny that its individual effect is almost unnoticeable, yet they soon\npile up, and if you encounter them all day and every day, they have a\nsignificant effect on your quality of life.\nAs you write each line of code, you should be thinking “How much\neffort does it take to understand this? Could I reduce that somehow?”\nThe secret of great software engineering is doing a lot of little things\nwell. Picking the right names, organising code in a logical fashion,\nhaving one idea per line of code: all these go towards cumulatively\nmaking your code readable and pleasant to work with.\nHow do you learn what’s idiomatic and conventional? By reading other\npeople’s programs, in the same careful and intentional way that we read\nour own. You can’t write a good novel if you’ve never read a\nnovel, and the same applies to programming.\nPrograms found in the wild are of variable quality, and you should\nmake sure to sample as wide a range as you can. It’s just as useful to\nread bad programs as good ones, though for different reasons. You’ll\nfind mistakes even in good programs, and when you do, you’ll have\nlearned something. But the most useful thing of all is to learn what\neverybody does.\nSimple\nAh, simplicity. Is there any more\nslippery and deceptive concept? Everyone thinks they know simplicity\nwhen they see it, but oddly enough no two people agree on what “simple”\nmeans in practice.\nAs Rich Hickey has pointed out, simple isn’t the same\nas easy. “Easy” is familiar, low-effort, the thing we reach for\nwithout thinking. That usually results in “complex”, so getting it to\n“simple” can take a good deal of effort and thought.\nOne attribute that simple code tends to have is directness:\nit does just what it says on the tin. It doesn’t have weird and\nunexpected side effects, or conflate several unrelated things.\nDirectness is inversely related to concision: if there are three similar\ntasks to do, a simple program will do it with three similar\nfunctions.\nThis is one reason people find it hard to write simple code: we’re\nall terrified of repeating ourselves. The DRY principle is so\ningrained that we even use it as a verb: “we need to DRY up this\nfunction” (as Calvin noted, verbing\nweirds language).\nBut there’s nothing wrong with repetition in itself. I say again,\nthere’s nothing wrong with repetition in itself (see?) It can\nbe a valuable way of conveying emphasis. And if we find ourselves\ncreating new abstractions to no purpose other than avoiding repetition,\nthen we’ve gone wrong somewhere: that makes the program more complex,\nnot more simple.\nThat leads us to another aspect of simplicity: frugality.\nDoing a lot with a little. A package that does one thing is simpler than\none that does ten things. The fewer functions there are, and the\nshallower the stack, the simpler the program.\nThat might result in some long functions, and that’s okay.\nAll due respect to Uncle Bob, but a function should be as long as it\nneeds to be. Adding complexity purely to reduce the length of a\nfunction is a good example of a blindly-applied rule defeating common\nsense.\nSimplicity, as Alan Perlis observed, does not precede complexity, but\nfollows it. In other words, write the program first, then make it\nsimple. Read the code and ask what it says, then ask yourself if you can\nfind a simpler way to write the same thing.\nAnother place you can find simplicity is in naturalness. Any\ngiven language has its own Tao, its own\nnatural forms and structures, and working with them generally\ngets better results than working against them. For example, you can use\nGo as though it were Java, or Python,\nor Rust, but it’s simpler to write Go\nprograms in Go. Easier, too.\nPerformant\nYou might think it strange that I’ve listed this one last. Isn’t\npractically everything you hear or read about programming related to\nperformance in some way? Yes, it is. But I don’t think that’s\nnecessarily because performance is important so much as that\nit’s easy to talk about. What can be measured is what will be maximised,\nand it’s easy to measure performance: you can use a stopwatch. It’s much\nharder to quantify things like simplicity, or even correctness.\nBut if the code isn’t correct, who cares how fast it runs?\nTo put it another way, we can make a given function arbitrarily\nefficient if it doesn’t have to be correct.\nSimilarly, if it’s not simple, we will waste far more\nprogrammer time on understanding it than we could ever have\nshaved off the CPU time it takes. And programmers are more expensive to\nrun, per hour, than any CPU. Doesn’t it make sense to write code in a\nway that optimises for programmer time, not CPU time?\nAs I’ve noted elsewhere, performance doesn’t\nmatter for the vast majority of programs. When it does, the best\nsolution isn’t usually to make your code harder to read.\nThe saying “slow is smooth, and smooth is fast” applies here. If you\ntangle up your program in hopeless complexity to save a couple of\nmicroseconds off some loop, great, but that’s the last optimisation\nanyone will ever make to it.\nAttempting to speed up complex code is usually counterproductive,\nbecause if you don’t understand it you can’t optimise it. On the other\nhand, simple programs are easy to speed up when you have to.\nNevertheless, we should be aware of the performance\nimplications of the choices we make. If we didn’t need this task doing\nfairly quickly, we wouldn’t have given it to a computer.\nAnother way to think about it is that an efficient program can\ndo more in a given time, even if the actual time taken is\nirrelevant.\nTo be fair, even an inefficient program will run pretty fast: “the\ninside of a computer is dumb as hell,” Richard Feynman observed, “but it\ngoes like mad”. That’s not to say that we can afford to waste\ncompute cycles, because all computation costs energy, and we are already\nheating up our planet at a ludicrously unsustainable rate. It would be a\nshame if we ended up emitting a few extra gigatons of carbon just\nbecause we made some clumsy choice of data structure.\nThe idea of “mechanical sympathy” is helpful to bear in mind when\nyou’re programming. It means that you have some understanding of how the\nmachine works, fundamentally, and you take care not to abuse it\nor get in its way. For example, if you don’t know what memory is, how\ncan you write efficient programs?\nI often see code that blithely slurps in entire data files into a\nsingle structure, then proceeds to actually process them just a\nfew bytes at a time. I learned to program on a machine with 1K of\nmemory, or about a thousand words, and that will teach you the value of\na byte, believe me.\nI’m writing this, some years later, on a machine with about 16\nmillion words of memory, and don’t run out of them quite so\nfrequently, but nonetheless, memory matters.\nFor one thing, the more data you’re schlepping around the system, the\nlonger it takes. And for another thing, however big your Kubernetes cluster, it nonetheless\nconsists of physical machines with fixed, finite memory, and no\ncontainer can use more than the total RAM of a single node.\nSo look after your bytes, and the gigabytes will look after\nthemselves.\n\n            John Arundel\n\n              Go, golang, crisp code, clean code, readability\n\n        Twitter\n\n        LinkedIn0\n\n        Reddit\n\nJohn Arundel\n\nJohn Arundel\n\n  Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.

      "en": "**Summary of \"Don't write clean code, write CRISP code\" by John Arundel**\n\nJohn Arundel discusses the concept of writing \"CRISP\" code, which stands for Correct, Readable, Idiomatic, Simple, and Performant. He emphasizes that while everyone agrees on the importance of \"clean code,\" defining it can be challenging.\n\n1. **Correct**: Code must function as intended. Good tests help ensure correctness, but they can also be flawed. It's crucial to approach testing with skepticism and humility, assuming that code might be incorrect.\n\n2. **Readable**: Code should be easy to understand. Readability is often sacrificed for other priorities, but it is essential for maintaining code over time. Arundel advises reading code carefully and intentionally to identify areas that may confuse future readers.\n\n3. **Idiomatic**: Following conventions in code helps with understanding. Using standard names and structures makes it easier for others to read and maintain the code. Familiarity with idiomatic practices comes from studying other people's code.\n\n4. **Simple**: Simplicity is key to effective code. Simple code is direct and avoids unnecessary complexity. Arundel argues that simplicity often requires effort to achieve and that repetition can sometimes enhance clarity rather than detract from it.\n\n5. **Performant**: While performance is important, Arundel argues that it should not overshadow correctness or simplicity. A focus on performance can lead to complex code that is hard to maintain. Efficient code should be a goal, but it's more important to optimize for programmer time than CPU time.\n\nOverall, Arundel encourages developers to strive for CRISP code, balancing these principles to create better software.",
      "ko": "존 아룬델은 \"CRISP\" 코드 작성 개념에 대해 이야기합니다. CRISP는 Correct(정확함), Readable(가독성), Idiomatic(관용적), Simple(단순함), Performant(성능)이라는 다섯 가지 요소의 약자입니다. 그는 \"클린 코드\"의 중요성에는 모두 동의하지만, 이를 정의하는 것은 어려울 수 있다고 강조합니다.\n\n첫째, 정확함은 코드가 의도한 대로 작동해야 한다는 것입니다. 좋은 테스트는 정확성을 보장하는 데 도움이 되지만, 결함이 있을 수도 있습니다. 따라서 테스트를 수행할 때는 회의적이고 겸손한 태도로 접근하는 것이 중요합니다. 코드가 잘못되었을 가능성을 염두에 두어야 합니다.\n\n둘째, 가독성은 코드가 이해하기 쉬워야 한다는 점입니다. 가독성은 종종 다른 우선사항을 위해 희생되지만, 시간이 지나도 코드를 유지보수하는 데 필수적입니다. 아룬델은 코드를 신중하고 의도적으로 읽어보아야 하며, 미래의 독자를 혼란스럽게 할 수 있는 부분을 찾아내야 한다고 조언합니다.\n\n셋째, 관용적이라는 것은 코드에서 관습을 따르는 것이 이해를 돕는다는 것입니다. 표준 이름과 구조를 사용하면 다른 사람들이 코드를 읽고 유지보수하기가 더 쉬워집니다. 관용적 관행에 대한 친숙함은 다른 사람의 코드를 연구함으로써 얻을 수 있습니다.\n\n넷째, 단순함은 효과적인 코드의 핵심입니다. 단순한 코드는 직관적이며 불필요한 복잡성을 피합니다. 아룬델은 단순함을 이루기 위해서는 노력이 필요하며, 반복이 때로는 명확성을 높이는 데 도움이 될 수 있다고 주장합니다.\n\n마지막으로 성능은 중요하지만, 아룬델은 성능이 정확성이나 단순함을 가리는 것이 되어서는 안 된다고 말합니다. 성능에 집중하다 보면 유지보수가 어려운 복잡한 코드가 될 수 있습니다. 효율적인 코드를 목표로 삼는 것은 좋지만, CPU 시간보다 프로그래머의 시간을 최적화하는 것이 더 중요하다고 강조합니다.\n\n전반적으로 아룬델은 개발자들이 CRISP 코드를 목표로 삼아 이 원칙들을 균형 있게 적용하여 더 나은 소프트웨어를 만들도록 권장합니다.",

As The Register reported late last year, PC sales were showing little sign of rebounding, despite the efforts of vendors to draw buyer attention with AI-capable systems, which have bells and whistles including a neural processing unit (NPU) – specialized circuitry for accelerating certain tasks.\n\"Nvidia's approach to AI PC is to provide more compute to developer hands through Spark,\" Vladimir Galabov, Omdia Research Director for Cloud and Datacenter, told us.\n\n                <a href=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_onprem/front&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=3&amp;c=33Z-rEbyCIkKpXmBuYkNfmEwAAAEU&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0\" target=\"_blank\">\n                    <img src=\"https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&amp;iu=/6978/reg_onprem/front&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&amp;tile=3&amp;c=33Z-rEbyCIkKpXmBuYkNfmEwAAAEU&amp;t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0\" alt=\"\">\n                </a>\n\n\"I like that this device is usable with any PC and utilizes the same programming platform as the rest of Nvidia's computers. We all use hard drives for external storage. It's the same concept but for AI computing.\"\nBy contrast, the mainstream AI PC hype is targeted at consumers and corporate users rather than scientists. The lack of killer applications and the hefty price tag has put off most buyers so far.\nGalabov said: \"AI PCs align with the push for tools like Copilot to make your life easier. Nvidia is not competing with this. They are creating a new market through a new form factor, a satellite AI device that can be used with any PC platform,\" .\nThat all sounds good, yet a device aimed at AI developers and data scientists is a little too niche to rattle the cage of the mainstream PC market leaders, although Fortune Business Insights does estimate the global data science platform market reached $133 billion during 2024.\nOther analysts also view Nvidia's step into high-margin devices as somewhat specialized kit that isn't for everyone.\n\"The DGX Spark, despite its 'mini PC' form factor, appears to be positioned as a more specialized and robust solution for AI development and local LLM experimentation than typical consumer-grade AI PCs,\" Context chief analyst Antonio Talia told us. \"Its focus on large unified memory caters specifically to the demands of larger AI models, a characteristic that differentiates it from more general-purpose AI PCs.\"\nAI-capable PCs now account for 50 percent of laptops flowing through European distribution channels, Context says. This surge, however, is more about increased product availability and short-term price cuts than a sudden boom in consumers clamouring to buy these systems.\n\"We have seen an 11-percentage point jump in just one week,\" Talia said. \"This dramatic week-on-week growth reflects a spike in the availability of AI-capable systems, rather than a fundamental shift in end-user demand.\"\n\nA closer look at Dynamo, Nvidia's 'operating system' for AI inference\n\nNvidia invests in quantum computing weeks after CEO said it's decades from being useful\n\nSchneider Electric plugs into AI's power hunger with Nvidia digital twin tech\n\nNvidia wants to put a GB300 Superchip on your desk with DGX Station, Spark PCs\n\nDGX Station is different again from AI PCs, presented as a desktop-sized machine explicitly designed for AI and described as \"what a PC should look like for serious machine learning, data science, and LLMs,\" according to Talia.\nIts specifications far exceed those of typical workstations, meaning that while its cost is unknown, it's likely to be costly given the DGX Spark's pricing, so again it's not for the average user.\nThere's little indication that these will disrupt the enterprise PC market – and although there are whispers of a possible laptop form factor that Nvidia might have in the pipeline, Acer's probably not panicking about losing customers that are looking to buy entry-level or mid-range priced notebooks.\nIn other parts of the infrastructure, Omdia points out Nvidia is gunning for the enterprise stack with its software ecosystem, ranging from OS to development platforms, to pre-trained model-as-a-service (AI apps). At GTC, Nvidia showed off a software framework called Dynamo that it described as the \"operating system of an AI factory.\"\nGalabov points to numerous alliances the GPU maker has already forged to provide what are essentially managed AI services. \"Partners like Accenture and HPE are simply integrating Nvidia's software stack into an existing services portfolio,\" he told us.\nNvidia is also moving steadily further into networking. As well as showing off Spectrum-X and Quantum-X switches with co-packaged optics at GTC, last month it teamed with Cisco to make Cisco Silicon One part of the Spectrum-X platform. Switchzilla will build systems using Nvidia's Spectrum silicon.\n\"I think it's important to recognize Nvidia's inroads in selling switch ICs to Cisco making them an even bigger player in enterprise networking. Same with storage where I think they will gain access to a whole new total addressable market,\" Galabov said.\nWith $70 plus billion in net profit last year, Nvidia has the wherewithal to leap into any market, yet dominance in one space doesn't necessarily equate to, er, disruption in another.\nStill, with that much financial muscle, CEO Jensen Huang can afford to fail, and if he wins then the price tags of this new range of products suggests he'll win big. And could lead to bigger... disruptions. ®\n                                    <strong>Get our</strong> <a href=\"https://whitepapers.theregister.com/\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Tech Resources</a>\n\n        Share\n\n            More about\n\n                Nvidia\n\n        More like these\n\n            ×\n\n                    More about\n\n                Nvidia\n\n                    Narrower topics\n\n                GTC\n\n                Omniverse\n\n                    More about\n\n        Share\n\n                2\n\n                    COMMENTS\n\n            More about\n\n                Nvidia\n\n        More like these\n\n            ×\n\n                    More about\n\n                Nvidia\n\n                    Narrower topics\n\n                GTC\n\n                Omniverse\n\n        TIP US OFF\n        Send us news",

However, the hype around AI PCs has not translated into significant sales, as many consumers find the cost and lack of compelling applications off-putting.\n\nDespite AI-capable laptops making up a significant portion of sales in Europe, this growth is attributed more to increased availability than a surge in demand. Nvidia's new products are seen as specialized tools for professionals rather than mainstream devices that could disrupt the broader PC market.\n\nNvidia is also enhancing its software and networking capabilities, indicating a strategic push to integrate its technology across different enterprise solutions. With substantial profits, Nvidia has the resources to venture into new markets, but whether these moves will lead to major disruptions remains uncertain.",

DECISIONA dark mass of clouds hung low over North Charleston as Marine Col. Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo began his descent. It was a Sunday afternoon, late September 2023. Del Pizzo's hands were on the control stick and throttle of an F-35B Lightning II, the U.S. military’s most advanced stealth fighter, a $136 million supercomputer with wings. The F-35B can hover like a helicopter, and Del Pizzo planned to use that technology to land.Del Pizzo had just finished a training sortie over the Atlantic with a second F-35B pilot, practicing tactics at upwards of 500 mph at seven times the force of gravity. He needed to experience this jet’s strengths and weaknesses. At 48, he was a full bird colonel getting ready to command a squadron in Yuma, Ariz., a high-visibility assignment to fine-tune the Marines’ aviation strategies and procedures, including those for the F-35B.As he closed in on Charleston Air Force Base, he knew he’d hit some bumps. Forecasters earlier had said the weather would improve, but the opposite happened. Heavy clouds moved in like a big gray curtain. He shot through some turbulence, streaks of precipitation on the canopy, zero visibility. He’d use his instruments to get through it all. No big deal. Pilots do instrument landings all the time in crud like this.And the F-35 was packed with instruments, cameras and sensors— all feeding a torrent of data into computers linked to his $400,000 helmet display. The helmet itself was an engineering wonder, custom built for each pilot. It had a dark visor that displayed the jet’s speed, altitude and targeting information, all of which moved with his head. The jet had cameras mounted on the bottom of the plane that streamed videos to the visor. If he looked down, this fusion of data and optics allowed him to see through the plane’s smooth shark-gray shell.Suddenly, at 1:32:05 p.m., his helmet flickered. What was that? The plane seemed to be OK. Then the visor erupted in flashes of alerts. Failures in flight control systems, avionics, cooling, navigation, GPS, communications. Audio alerts sounded: whoop, whoop, whoop. Then the helmet and main displays went dark; the audio alerts stopped. About 15 seconds had passed.Military aviators are taught to make quick decisions using an “OODA Loop”— observe, orient, decide and act. The goal is to cycle through the loop’s four phases faster than your opponent. In this case, Del Pizzo’s opponents were the weather and his jet. The helmet display flashed back on. He ran a loop. Observe, orient: Jet still in the clouds, about 750 feet above ground, still in his control, descending glide path, about 800 feet per minute. Decide, act: Execute a missed approach procedure and get away from the ground.He pulled back the stick to climb, pushed the throttle forward for thrust.Raised the landing gear. Pressed a button that converts the jet from vertical mode to conventional. Then the helmet display went dark again, as if rebooting. He tried to radio his wingman, the control tower. Nothing. Coms out. Then it flashed on, along with another thunderstorm of alerts, more than 25 messages telling him that the jet was in deep trouble and getting worse. Whoop, whoop, whoop.About 30 seconds had passed.The helmet and main display failed a third time, differently now, as if powering down for good. Instruments gone, a sea of gray outside his window. Is the plane responding? He pulled the throttle back. He glanced at the small backup panel between his legs. He heard what sounded like a motor spooling down. The engine? He felt the nose of the aircraft tilt upward. He felt a falling sensation. He still couldn’t see the ground. Was he still over the base? Over the trees?Forty-one seconds. Decide, act: The jet’s going into the trees, and I’m going with it. In one quick motion, he reached between his legs for the yellow handle, put his left hand over his right wrist.And pulled.Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time0:00/Duration0:00Loaded: 0%Stream TypeLIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time-0:001xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions and subtitles off, selectedAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

SEMPER FIA decision, once acted upon, always changes your trajectory. And for fighter pilots, decisions come at Mach speed. To make quicker ones, pilots train like professional athletes, doing rep after rep until important decisions are intuitive and instantaneous.Effective procedures are key. At their essence, procedures are based on actions people took in the past that proved to be good ones, decisions worth repeating in the future, especially under pressure. Having procedures in place also means that when something goes sideways you’re protected, not punished— as long as you followed those preset rules. All this makes you and your unit faster and more confident warfighters, especially in combat, when second-guessing can be fatal.This was the system Del Pizzo grew up in, the system he followed as a young Marine flying AV-8B Harriers. It’s the system he trusted while training and flying more than 2,800 hours in 12 different military aircraft, 759 hours in combat. The system that led to a stream of promotions, to decorations like the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, 19 Air Medals. It’s the system that propelled him to a coveted command assignment. One that had his superiors saying he could someday make general. A system that gave him a profound sense of belonging that only other Marines really understand. Semper fi.And after those 41 seconds in the cockpit of a failing stealth fighter, it’s a system that betrayed him.His story, shared here for the first time, details his journey back into the cockpit after the mishap, and then how that journey suddenly ended when the Marines relieved him of command more than a year after he pulled the ejection handle. His story answers many questions about what happened that stormy Sunday afternoon in 2023 over North Charleston, but also raises new ones with stakes that go beyond his mishap: Did the Marines create a dangerous precedent by relieving Del Pizzo? One that makes pilots hesitate to punch out of a malfunctioning aircraft?And, from another altitude: As everything from cars to fighter jets become more dependent on technology, who’s to blame when those machines fail you?\n\n                                    Even when he was 2 or 3, Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo wanted to fly.\n\n                                    Provided\n\n        3. FLYERDel Pizzo always wanted to fly. You can see the proof in the old photos. They’re displayed on the laptop he opened recently on the countertop of a mostly empty house near Washington, D.C.There he was in a time-faded snapshot, age 2 or 3, smiling in a cockpit of a retired A-4 Skyhawk at a Florida air base, the same jet his father flew in Vietnam. A huge white helmet covered the boy’s bright red hair.And in another shot, about the same age, swallowed up by his dad’s khaki uniform shirt with his Navy wings and ribbons. And there in a third photo, grinning even more in his dad’s Navy dress jacket, his father holding him and smiling, too.Del Pizzo looked away from the laptop. Around him, the house had an echo that empty houses have. He and his family will move in soon. After 31 years in the Marines, he’d finally retired, honorable discharge. He’d arrived that morning after driving from Yuma in a rented U-Haul, his Jeep towed behind.Del Pizzo is a thin man with thick hair that’s still red. He doesn’t quite fit the movie star version of the cocky fighter jet jock. He’s confident but freely tosses out self-deprecating jokes. He speaks more easily about others in his life than himself. Like his grandfather.Next to his laptop on the kitchen counter was the metal canteen cup his grandfather carried in World War II, hand-etched with the European countries he marched through under Gen. George Patton’s command. “He was a poor Italian kid in Philly who married the rich Irish girl he met at church, one of those guys who could hear a song once and then play it on the piano without taking lessons.”Growing up, Del Pizzo thought he’d end up in the Navy like his father. “My dad could fix anything on the car. You know, it's funny what you lose in generations — like I have no Italian language skills, no car-fixing skills. But I guess I got the pilot gene.”\n\n                                    A cup carried in World War II by the grandfather of Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo, Sunday, March 9, 2025, at his new rental homenear Washington, D.C.\n\n                                    Robert Scheer/Staff\n\n        After Vietnam, his father flew jets for the now-defunct Eastern Airlines. The family moved to Atlanta, a major hub.“I was an airline kid. My dad loved flying, and I don’t remember a time in my life growing up that I didn’t want to fly jets just like my dad.”At 17, he did boot camp at Parris Island in South Carolina, but he still thought he'd end up in the Navy like his father. From boot camp, he went to Auburn University, mixing college with military training during summers. He also made a course correction. The Marines offered him a faster route to flying jets than the Navy. After graduating with a degree in criminal justice, he flew straight into flight school in Pensacola, Fla.By then, he already had his pilot’s license, and his love of flight only grew as he logged more time in the air: the eerie night skies, the early mornings when you broke through the cloud bank and saw the rising sun resting on top of it. It might be raining and dark below, but above it was wonderful.“When I'm in the air, I feel like that's where I'm supposed to be. And when I'm not in the air, I want to get back there.”\n\n                                    Marine aviator Charles \"Cheez\" Del Pizzo leading a four-plane formation over Iraq in 2016 on the way to Mosul. Del Pizzo's Harrier is second from right. Harriers once were the most dangerous jet in the military, but numerous improvements made it a stalwart.\n\n                                    Provided\n\n        4. COMBATBy 25, he was flying Harriers, the jump jet created by Great Britain, a stubby, muscular aircraft that was the first fighter to take off and land vertically like a helicopter. His call sign was “Cheez,” which loosely rhymed with the way he pronounced Del Pizzo (Peezo).The Harrier’s ability to hover allowed pilots to land without runways. But they were beasts to fly.During the Harrier’s first two decades of service, at least 45 Marines died in noncombat incidents, making it one of the military’s most dangerousairplanes to fly. Over time, the Marines made adjustments and improved procedures, and the mishap rate declined. But the Corps still typically picked the most skilled pilots to fly these finicky birds.In 2003, Del Pizzo was deployed to the Middle East for Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was his first combat deployment, and his father met him just as he was about to leave. They hadn’t talked much about Vietnam, so he was a little surprised when his father hugged him and said: “You know, I went to war so you wouldn’t have to.”But soon Del Pizzo was crossing into Iraqi airspace with 11 other Harriers and hundreds of U.S. and allied aircraft. The sun had just set. The darkening sky was filled with Iraqi long-range artillery shells flying over them. Ballistic missiles headed toward them. He saw explosions over a hill where Marines on the ground breached a defense. But when it came time to drop his 1,000-pound bomb, it wouldn’t release, stuck because something was too tight. OODA Loop time. Observe: Bomb still there. Orient: Plane OK. Decide, act: Continue with the mission and get the jet back to the base.Roughly a decade later, he was flying a Harrier to New Mexico for an exercise. At about 25,000 feet, a fire broke out in the avionics bay, frying the plane's electronics, radar, main displays and systems that stabilized the plane. He worked with air traffic controllers to guide him in, and he landed without incident.Military aviators who knew him said he had an uncanny ability to stay “ahead of the jet”— calmly manage a flood of information about targets, threats, troops on the ground, while piloting a plane at 500 mph. “If you were flying north into Iraq, he was the guy you wanted to lead the mission,” said Guy Berry, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former Harrier pilot.Time passed, and Del Pizzo’s trajectory through the Marine Corps moved upward and steady: deployments to Afghanistan, Kuwait and Japan; deployments to Bahrain for combat missions into Syria for Operation Inherent Resolve. He flew Harriers off amphibious assault ships. At the Pentagon, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff working on Southeast Asia policy, and with Navy staff on amphibious expedition warfare. He worked in the F-35 Joint Program Office, where he served as the senior Marine representative and at Marine Headquarters. His mentors included Marine generals.In 2022, he was selected to take command of Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron 1 in Yuma, referred to as VMX-1. It was a choice assignment where Marines test their aircraft to make sure procedures and standards work in real-world scenarios.To Del Pizzo, commanding VMX-1 would be the pinnacle of his career as a military aviator. Good procedures and standards tested in Yuma could save Marines’ lives in the field. But he wouldn’t formally take command that year. The Marines were short of colonels, and he was assigned more duties at the Pentagon. In the interim, he also needed to learn how to fly the F-35B. And to do that, he traveled to Beaufort.\n\n            Buy Now\n\n                                    An F-35B at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, where Marines train F-35B pilots from around the world.\n\n                                    File/Gavin McIntyre/Staff\n\n        Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort is home of the “Warlords,” Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501. The base is off U.S. Highway 21, past a drive-in theater. A slight rise offers a brief view of runways and khaki outdoor canopies shading F-35Bs. A sign at the base entrance says, \"The 'noise' you hear is the sound of freedom.\"It’s one of two Marine F-35B training centers, with the second in San Diego. It has advanced simulators and a time-tested curriculum. “Hands down, it was the best training I’d ever had, world-class,” Del Pizzo said.He flew an F-35B for the first time in April 2023, returning to the Beaufort base with a smile on his face. The jet was the most impressive machine he’d ever flown, a mind meld with computers and brute force.As a future commander of VMX-1, he needed to know as much about the F-35B as possible. The F-35 is the military’s most ambitious weapons system, a $2 trillion investment over the next 50 years in the nation’s air defense capabilities. The jet has three variations: the F-35A, used mainly by the Air Force; the F-35B, which can hover; and the F-35C, which has a more robust structure for carrier landings. All three variants have a stealthy shape and advanced composite shells to evade enemy radar.But its real value is in the electronics inside; computers and sensors take over some of the pilot’s duties, so pilots become quarterbacks, directing other planes to their targets or serving as forward spotters for ground artillery.But complex systems can come with potential flaws; because these systems build on one another, failures can propagate like a virus.\n        A U.S. Marine Corps pilot demonstrates the F-35B Lighting II’s capabilities during an airshow in Beaufort in 2023.

THE FALL After you pull the ejection handle on a fighter jet, straps on the seat instantly pin your arms and legs so they don’t flail when you hit the slipstream. Air bags inflate around your neck and head. A line of explosives above your head shatters the canopy. Rockets on the seat fire, launching you and the seat with a force 18 times greater than gravity. By the time the chute opens, only 3 seconds have passed.Fighter pilots know that about one of 10 ejections lead to death, and one out of 3 end up with spinal damage or other severe injuries.WhenDel Pizzopulled the handle, he heard a bang like a shotgun shell. Shards of metal dug into his neck from the explosives that blasted the canopy apart.“The next thing I remember, as I began to come up the seat rail, my helmet and mask got ripped off in the wind stream, ripped straight off my face.“I remember feeling the precipitation on my face, and then just being pulled back as the drogue chute opened and slowed me down.” (A drogue chute is a small parachute that stops the pilot from tumbling.)“And I could hear the engine noise from the airplane. With my helmet off, it was pretty loud. What I heard was complete chaos. Things falling around me. And that's when I thought the airplane is going to come down and hit me, because I felt like the airplane was out of control, right? I thoughtthe airplane is going to hit me, and I'm going to die here in this parachute.”He wouldn’t learn until much later that after he ejected, the jet converted from its vertical mode to conventional and kept flying.A few more seconds passed, and he dropped below the clouds. Another OODA Loop. Observe, orient: He could see the ground now, but no sign of the plane crash; he was above a neighborhood, heading toward power lines. Decide, act: A survival kit attached to a lanyard dangled below him; he released it to avoid snagging in the wires; he reached up for the chute’s toggles and steered toward a house. He aimed for a backyard about the size of an average living room.He landed by the back fence, his chute tangling in the trees. It was raining. His back hurt. He walked to the house’s backdoor and knocked.A shocked family opened the door.“They were looking at me in my wet flight suit in their backyard, with me telling them I needed to call 911.”After a moment, a woman and her son ushered him into the kitchen. The father helped Del Pizzo stop some bleeding from the shrapnel wounds. The son called 911, and after briefly talking to the dispatcher, handed Del Pizzo the phone.“I’m the pilot,” Del Pizzo can be heard saying in the recording. “We need to get rescue rolling. I’m not sure where the airplane is. It would have crash-landed somewhere. I ejected.”The dispatcher was slow to understand, and Del Pizzo said it was unfair to criticize her, as some on social media did after news organizations posted the 911 recording. What happened was highly unusual, he said. Something that dispatchers probably wouldn’t see in their own training. Uppermost in his mind as he talked to the dispatcher and arriving paramedics: What happened to the jet?“My biggest fear was that I’d hurt someone.”Paramedics loaded him in an ambulance, and they sped to the Medical University of South Carolina in downtown Charleston. During the trip, he accidentally pocket-dialed his eldest teenage son, who could only hear voices and sirens in the background.At some point, he called his wife, Jessica, who was at their youngest son’s flag football game. He knew that mishaps trigger investigations. Protocols required him to keep details at a minimum. So the conversation was short on specifics, mainly that he was alive.In the ambulance, he kept asking if the plane crash had hurt anyone. No, the paramedics told him, there was no word of a crash. Same thing in the hospital.“I thought the plane would come down in someone’s backyard, or hit someone’s house, and that horrified me.”But why wasn’t there any news? An ejected pilot without a plane crash? It was like a surreal riddle. He was so baffled that at one point he turned to a doctor.“I asked, ‘Am I dead?’ No one could give me any information about the airplane.”There, in the emergency room, he also learned he’d broken his back.\n\n                                    A photograph of the ejection seat from a military investigation into the 2023 F-35B incident over North Charleston.\n\n                                    Defense Department\n\n        6. MYSTERYIn military aviation circles, an unintended incident that leads to a death, injury or significant property damage is called a “mishap”—not an accident— and mishaps trigger a cascade of investigations. The probes into Del Pizzo’s mishap were especially sensitive given the secrecy of the F-35’s stealth technology and capabilities, and what happened after he ejected.Instead of the smoking hole he expected below him, the jet climbed at a 5-degree angle to about 9,300 feet, then descended in a long right turn. It flew for 11 minutes and 21 seconds, an average speed of at least 350 mph. In Williamsburg County, the jet clipped the tops of trees. The jet crashed near a swamp and fields in a community called Indianland. Investigators later pegged its speed on impact at 635 mph.\n\n                googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n                        googletag.display('ad-1616269');\n\n                });\n\n                googletag.cmd.push(function() {\n                        googletag.display('ad-1616260');\n\n                });\n\nIn heavily redacted documents later released by the military, investigators also described an “electrical malfunction” that knocked out radios, tactical navigation systems, landing guidance systems and a key transponder that would have automatically sent the jet’s location to air traffic controllers. The loss of that tracking device and the jet’s stealthy design made it more difficult to pinpoint the crash site.Hours passed without news of a crash. The void created an opening, especially on social media. It didn’t help when an Air Force spokesperson sought help from the public. A stealth fighter missing? Memes popped up with a sign on a telephone pole, with a photo of an F-35 and a caption: “Have you seen this plane?” Could the military really lose such a connected plane?In the hospital, Del Pizzo suspected an electrically charged media storm was brewing outside. A Marine buddy showed up after driving all night from North Carolina.“He was following things on social media and said, ‘You’re trending on Twitter.’ I laughed, and then he said: ‘No, it’s not you. It’s the airplane.’ ”His wife, Jessica, soon arrived.“He’s not on social media much, but I took away his phone,” she recalled. “I didn’t want him to see those memes.”At one point, Del Pizzo heard the commandant of the Marines, Gen. Eric M. Smith, wanted to speak with him. That surprised Del Pizzo.Maybe it was merely an effort to express concern to a fellow Marine. But such a conversation could go against standard protocols to keep investigations as objective and influence-free as possible.“I think it was surrounding some of the things going on in the media at the time,” Del Pizzo said, “and maybe he wanted some answers.”He learned later that a senior officer persuaded Smith not to talk to him. It was a hint of the mishap’s sensitivity and the trouble to come.After about 24 hours without a crash site location, a South CarolinaCivil Air Patrol team identified a promising target near Hemingway based on its analysis of radar pings. Search teams moved in. Residents told them they’d heard a loud bang and flash that Sunday afternoon. A military fire official noted scorched trees near Boggy Swamp and found the debris, closing one loop.But more questions lingered as military workers sealed off the site: Why did Del Pizzo eject when the plane continued to fly? Had something gone wrong with the plane's technology?Did Del Pizzo punch out too early?Against this backdrop, Del Pizzo and his wife left the hospital, him in a back brace. He had cracked vertebrae in his lower and middle back, but doctors said his prognosis was good. After a night in a local hotel, they went to Charleston International Airport and waited for a flight back to Washington, D.C.“It was good to get out of that area because so many people were talking about it,” Jessica Del Pizzo recalled. “But I remember that at the airport we looked at each other and said how weird it was to be getting in an airplane.”\n\n                                    U.S. Marine Corps Col.

LESSONS Three separate investigations would explore what happened and why, each with a different focus.A Navy Aviation Mishap Board had teams of F-35 aviators, engineers and experts. Its goal was to identify mistakes and weaknesses, and draw up lessons to prevent future mishaps. Underlying the board’s work were legal protections that prevented superiors from punishing pilots and crews for anything they told investigators. Results of this investigation aren’t released to the public.The second investigation was the Field Flight Performance Board. Its main aim: Look at the pilot's actions.Led by a senior F-35 pilot, it also included experienced military aviators and experts. The board's report typically isn't released to the public.The third was the Marines’ Command Investigation. A senior officer handled this one.These probes usually have a limited scope. Their goal is primarily legal: to determine whether a pilot engaged in misconduct. Results of this investigation can be released to the public.The first two investigations came to similar conclusions, according to Del Pizzo, officials knowledgeable about the reports’ contents and documents obtained by The Post and Courier through open records laws: Del Pizzo’s aircraft experienced a significant electrical malfunction, one that knocked out key systems— including displays and navigation aids he needed to land in severe weather. Knobs to radios weren’t working, making it difficult to contact air traffic controllers or his wingman for guidance. A small backup display was partially functional, but Del Pizzo had to look down to see it.This and the zero-visibility conditions likely contributed to a phenomenon known as spatial disorientation, where your inner ear tricks you into feeling that you’re dizzy or falling.Both investigations noted that nothing in the military’s training and simulator work prepared pilots for a crescendo of systems failures in severe weather at a low altitude. In fact, the F-35B’s flight manual said, “the aircraft is considered to be in out of controlled flight (OCF) when it fails to respond properly to pilot inputs,” adding, “if out of control below 6,000 feet AGL (above ground level): EJECT.”Both investigations concluded that most highly experienced pilots with similar levels of experience in an F-35 would have punched out of the plane.The Field Flight Performance Board lauded Del Pizzo’s record and potential to move on after the mishap.“Colonel Del Pizzo is a career-long high performing naval aviator and Marine officer. There is no indication that Colonel Del Pizzo was overconfident in his abilities or reckless in mission execution … The board unanimously believes that Colonel Del Pizzo exercised sound judgment in his actions on 17 September 2023.”And both investigation boards made numerous recommendations, including new scenarios in simulators and changes in training. In Del Pizzo’s mind, that was how the system was supposed to work.But the officer in charge of the third investigation came to a different conclusion. The officer agreed that Del Pizzo followed procedures under difficult conditions, and that Del Pizzo didn’t engage in any misconduct. However, he found the mishap “occurred as a result of pilot error, in that the MP (mishap pilot) incorrectly diagnosed an OCF flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft.”His report pegged the cost of the plane's loss at $136 million.Del Pizzo reviewed that report in early 2024, while still recovering from his broken back. He disagreed with the logic. Without a massive system failure while flying blind in the clouds, he wouldn’t have ejected. This investigation also went beyond its normal scope of determining misconduct, which Del Pizzo and other experienced aviators interviewed for this story said was highly unusual. But Command Investigation reports typically didn’t carry the same weight as the other two safety investigations.And the report’s conclusion that he was to blame didn’t seem to affect his career arc.His back healed, and he was cleared to fly fighter jets again. By April 2024, seven months after the mishap, he was back in Beaufort,climbing into an F-35B, feeling a sense of gratitude for another chance. Those flights also would solve another mystery.Just before he ejected, he heard what he thought was the engine spooling down. But flying again in the F-35B he realized it wasn’t the engine, it was the powerful lift fan the plane uses in hover mode. The sound of the fan slowing down contributed to the illusion that he’d lost power and was falling. An important lesson to pass on to future pilots, he thought.And he was still on track to take command of VMX-1 in Arizona.\"I kept asking headquarters, 'Am I good?' Almost every week.\" They kept giving him the green light. \"The aviation leadership couldn't have been more supportive.\"In May 2024, he began moving his family to Yuma. That same month, he receivedthe Legion of Merit for his work at the Pentagon. Smith, the Marine commandant, visited Yuma that summer and seemed pleased. DelPizzo said at one point, Smith asked him about his future career plans. Del Pizzo said that he was weighing his options. Smith told him that command of VMX-1 wasn’t his last chapter as a Marine. “We put you here for a reason,” which Del Pizzo interpreted as a vote of confidence in his future in the Marines.Marine officers are regularly evaluated for their fitness to command, a report card of sorts that the commandant uses for promotions. Del Pizzo’s were stellar. Signed by two generals, one report in mid-2024 said: “Absolutely must promote, GO (general) potential… Cheez is a pure professional with unlimited future potential … Has my highest recommendation for promotion.”Another report later in 2024 said Del Pizzo’s work in Yuma was “setting the course for Marine Aviation’s future … highest recommendation for promotion … Place where our Corps’ hardest problems must be solved … Col. Del Pizzo’s potential in our Corps is unlimited.”So he was stunned when he got the call last October: After 103 days of command in Yuma, the commandant had relieved him of duty.Effective immediately.\n\n                                    Challenge coins in a storage box of Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo’s new rental homenear Washington, D.C.,Sunday, March 9, 2025.

BETRAYALThe news came in a video call with one of the two generals who had written that Del Pizzo had unlimited promotion potential.“I thought it was just a chance to catch up,” Del Pizzo recalled. “I thought, ‘This is great. I get some one-on-one time with the bosses and talk about how things are going.’ ”Instead, the conversation moved immediately to the mishap.The lieutenant general told him he’d done nothing wrong during his command in Yuma, but that a press release was about to be issued about Command Investigation’s findings. Smith, the commandant, had reviewed the report again and decided that Del Pizzo shouldn’t have such a high-visibility command. Results from the other two investigations, the ones that concluded Del Pizzo hadn’t been at fault, wouldn’t be released. The Marines would explain the sudden relief of command by saying it was due to a “loss of trust and confidence,” which hit Del Pizzo like a dagger because it implied misconduct.Stunned, Del Pizzo asked if he could have a small change of command ceremony— hand over the squadron’s flag as a way of thanking the people who had been so welcoming when he took over.Request denied.Soon, more than 300 Marines, sailors and civilians under his command in Yuma were told that he had been relieved for “misdiagnosis of an out-of-control flight situation.” Until then, only a small circle of people knew he’d ejected from the F-35B in South Carolina.Del Pizzo called his wife, Jessica,to meet him at the theirhome off base. He didn’t explain. She wondered why he didn't just send her a text.“I walked in the door and saw his face, and he looked completely defeated.\"Like her husband, she struggled to understand the timing and the treatment. All three investigations had been done in early 2024, but the Marines still gave him a green light to take command? Why put him and his family through a cross-country move? What had changed between early 2024 and that fall?“We replayed it all the time, going back and forth,” she recalled. “And we couldn’t figure it out.”Del Pizzo asked to speak to the commandant directly.“Obviously, I had a lot of questions.”Request denied.\n\n                                    F-35B Lightning IIs are assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.\n\n                                    File/Lance Cpl.

WRECKAGEThe F-35 program is the Defense Department’s most expensive weapons program, a decades-long push to replace many of the military’s earlier generation fighters, from F-16s to Harriers. The military has at least 630 F-35s across the Air Force, Navy and Marines, with plans to build a fleet of2,400 jetsover the coming years.But in 2023, the year of Del Pizzo’s mishap, F-35Bs were fully available for missions only 15 to 36 percent of the time, the Government Accountability Office reported. Critics of the F-35 cite the program’s costs and manufacturing delays. One big concern has been the jet's computers and software.Two months before Del Pizzo’s mishap, the Defense Department stopped accepting some newly built F-35s over frustration with Lockheed Martin’s pace of installing better displays and more powerful computers. Those technology upgrades are only now set to be in place this summer. Test pilots reportedly have had to reboot their radar and electronic warfare systems in midair, another GAO report said.The exact cause of the electrical malfunction in Del Pizzo’s mishap is hidden in redacted documents, pages the military said it blacked out for national security purposes. Unredacted portions ruled out some causes, though. Thunderstorms were in the area, but bolts at the time of the mishap were 20 miles away and couldn’t have fried the plane’s electronics. Investigators noted that the aircraft entered heavy rain five minutes before Del Pizzo ejected. But a Marine spokesperson said its investigation found no evidence that rainwater caused the electrical malfunction.Del Pizzo isn’t one of the F-35’s critics. In fact, he’s a big cheerleader of the technology and the jet’s potential. He sees its evolution through the lens of a Harrier pilot. Harriers had even more issues but became one of the military’s aviation stalwarts because of constant improvements in technology and procedures. He’d seen firsthand during his work at the Pentagon how tirelessly people in the F-35 program were working to do the same for that jet.Learning lessons was key, which is one reason he was so concerned about the way he was relieved of command. Punishing him moved the spotlight away from the jet’s issues.“We needed to take a hard look at that to prevent it from happening again,” he said. “In aviation, we have a culture. When there are errors, when things don't go as planned, we learn from them. If you don’t do that, then you have a culture of fear. And if you have a culture of fear, then people are going to be paralyzed and not be able to make decisions. And that's how people end up getting hurt. That's how people end up getting killed.”Some active duty and retired military aviators familiar with Del Pizzo's situation were appalled by his treatment.\"We fired a guy because of a press release,\" said one.Another added that the treatment of Del Pizzo sends a dangerous message: If you eject, your career is over. \"The easiest thing to do is blame the pilot.\"The Post and Courier provided officials at Marine Headquarters with a list of questions about the commandant's decision to relieve Del Pizzo, the timing of his order and whether he factored in whether his decision set a dangerous precedent for Marine aviators in the future. The newspaper also offered Gen. Smith a chance to respond personally. Marine officials acknowledged receiving the questions but did not provide any answers.\n\n                                    Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo chats with friend Miriam Smyth, Sunday, March 9, 2025, at his family’s new rental homenear Washington, D.C. Smyth is a retired Navy captain and is part of a large support system Del Pizzo has been helped by since he ejected from an F-35B jet over North Charleston in 2023.\n\n                                    Robert Scheer/Staff\n\n        10. CULTUREThere’s an aviation metaphor that business leaders and self-help gurus often deploy: During a flight, a plane is off-course 90 percent of the time. Reaching a destination means constant adjustments to turbulence, air traffic and sometimes human errors.Lives and careers have their own kinds of turbulence and course-changers. As Del Pizzo recentlyunpacked his U-Haul at the family’s newly rented home near Washington, D.C., he talked about adjustments in his life, namely what it was like to be newly retired from an institution that had for so long been part of his identity.He’s at peace with his decision to eject, though his mind also can start spinning what-ifs. What if the forecast had been more accurate? What if the cloud cover had been just a few hundred feet higher and he’d been able to see the ground? What if he had radio contact and could talk to his wingman? What if he decided not to retire? The commandant's order to relieve him probably killed any chances of promotion. What if he'd stuck it out? It can be difficult to close those loops.The deeper pain comes from what happened more than a year after he pulled the ejection handle.“Maybe it was just a business decision,” Del Pizzo said of the commandant’s move to relieve him of command. “But there's a human element that you have to take care of. You can't just discard someone because it's inconvenient or a bad headline, right? You need to make sure you take care of the people. That's how you maintain that culture of trust.”As he unpacked, schoolyard sounds could be heard in the distance. Yellow-and-gray plastic moving crates were stacked in the living room. Two friends, both retired military, showed up to help him get settled. You don’t really retire from the Marines. You’re still part of a group of people who helped forge who you are, and that never leaves you.He’d soon head back to Yuma to close the house down there, flying into the new unknowns of civilian life, questions lingering in the slipstream of 41 seconds of sensory chaos above North Charleston and 31 years as a Marine that ended because of someone else’s decision.\n\n                                    Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo, Sunday, March 9, 2025, takes a box upstairs at his family’s new rental homenear Washington, D.C. The now-retired former USMC colonel has been in this house about 24 hours and is trying to get a few things organized for his family before his evening flight back to Yuma, Ariz. later in the day.\n\n                                    Robert Scheer/Staff\n\n        ABOUT THIS STORYThis story began with the mystery surrounding the ejection and crash in 2023— and the length of time the Marines took to answer basic questions about what happened and why. Tony Bartelme’s previous reports in 2024 dove deep into the F-35’s history and pros and cons, while exploring the vacuum of information. Charles “Tre” Del Pizzo’s decision to tell his story answers many of those questions. He agreed to do so because he said he hoped lessons could be learned to help future Marines.To corroborate his story and other aspects of military investigation procedures, The Post and Courier interviewed a half-dozen military aviators, most of whom requested anonymity. The newspaper also interviewed F-35 experts, both critics and supporters. The newspaper obtained more than 700 pages of heavily redacted documents about the incident from the Defense Department and local law enforcement agencies. Del Pizzo provided documentation of his military record and fitness reports for our review.Bartelme and Robert Scheer traveled to Washington, D.C., for in-person interviews.

      "en": "**Summary: Inside a Marine's Ejection from an F-35B Fighter Jet**\n\nMarine Colonel Charles \"Tre\" Del Pizzo faced a critical situation while piloting an F-35B fighter jet in September 2023. After a series of system failures and loss of visibility during a storm, he made the difficult decision to eject from the aircraft, fearing it would crash. His ejection was successful, but he sustained injuries from shrapnel and a broken back.\n\nFollowing the incident, investigations revealed that the jet experienced a significant electrical malfunction that contributed to the failure of key systems, forcing Del Pizzo to eject. While two investigations cleared him of wrongdoing, a third investigation claimed he misdiagnosed the situation, leading to his relief from command in 2024, which came as a shock to him, especially given his prior commendations.\n\nDel Pizzo's story raises important questions about accountability and the treatment of pilots in high-pressure situations. His experience reflects broader issues within military aviation, including the impact of technology on pilot decision-making and a culture that may punish those who eject from malfunctioning aircraft.

    "content": "Ambermoon-Advanced\nEpisodes\nAs it is a major task for a single developer to finish such a huge project in a reasonable amount of time, I will release this extension as episodes which bring new content step by step. Five episodes are planned:\n\nMysteries of the sea\nElemental creatures\nThe green jewel\nBeneath the sands\nDifferent worlds\n\nVersions\nEpisode 2 was released as version 1.02. I planned that the minor version resembles the episode but I had to drop this as fixes had to be made and so version 1.03 is still episode 2 with fixes. Everything below 1.02 is episode 1. The third episode was now released as version 1.30. The new version scheme is 1.EH where E is the episode and H is the hotfix version for that episode. So hotfixes for episode 3 will be 1.31 and so on while the 4th episode will be 1.40 etc.\nHere is an overview of all released versions:\n\nVersion\nStatus Amiga\nStatus Remake\nEpisode\n\n0.01\nReleased\nReleased\n1\n\n1.02\nReleased\nReleased\n2\n\n1.03\nReleased\nReleased\n2\n\n1.30\nReleased\nReleased\n3\n\n1.31\nReleased\nReleased\n3\n\nOf course higher episodes include lower episodes.\nWhat it is\nAmbermoon Advanced is an inofficial extension of Ambermoon. It is developed and maintained by me (Pyrdacor).\nThe first official release 1.0x is out now in english and german. It contains the first two episodes \"Mysteries of the sea\" and \"Elemental creatures\". The 3rd episode is out now for the remake Ambermoon.net (currently only in german, translation is in progress), the Amiga version is not finished yet but I work on it.\nPlease keep in mind that I develop this on my own in my free time. So expect bugs, typos, bad texts, bad translations, unbalanced sections, dead ends and even crashes. Save often! If you get stuck or find bugs, please get in touch here on GitHub in the issue tracker or via mail (trobt@web.de).\nAmbermoon Advanced is playable on the Amiga. At least I hope so. I tested it with WinUAE so I am not 100% sure if it runs flawlessly on every Amiga hardware.\nWhat it's not\nAmbermoon Advanced is no complete new game, so you will still play Ambermoon as you know it but of course with some additions and changes. For example monsters now have elements and spells have elements too. Therefore some monsters are now immune to certain spells. Don't bother shooting fire balls at fire dragons or rocks at stone golems. In the second episode elemental spells will also have increase or reduced damage against specific elemental monsters. Moreover spell damage is then increased by intelligence and level.\nAlso keep in mind that adding content is a lot of work so don't expect the whole world to change or secrets in every dungeon. As Ambermoon Advanced is released in episodes the current changes focus on the early to late game on Lyramion. The two moons have no new content so far. This will change in the next episodes of course.\nIf you want to play the episodes in succession you should pause before you leave Lyramion for the first time.\nDownloads\nAmbermoon Advanced 1.31\n\nLanguage\nDownloads\n\nEnglish\nzip lha tar.gz\n\nDeutsch\nzip lha tar.gz\n\nAmbermoon Advanced 1.03 WHDLoad\n\nLanguage\nDownloads\n\nWHDLoad English\ndownload\n\nWHDLoad German\ndownload\n\nWalkthrough Tips\nAs many players struggle with the new content, I started to write a small hint section to make it easier to proceed. Of course I will also try to improve the game in the future to make this obsolete.\nWalkthrough Tips\nPrepare for the second episode\nThe second episode is out now. Unfortunately it wasn't possible to keep the savegames compatible with the ones from the first episode. However there is a savegame patcher online which you can use to patch your savegame to use it for the second episode. You can find it online at https://ambermoon-advanced.pyrdacor.net. Just drag&drop your savegame folders (e.g. Save.00) there and you will be able to\ndownload the patched version as a zip file.\nIf you use the remake Ambermoon.net you don't need to do this as the remake automatically upgrades your savegames on loading.\nNote: The patched savegames might be incompatible when playing the first episode with them.\nNote: Always backup your saves beforehand!\nNote: The patcher only works with Ambermoon Advanced savegames. Don't use original savegames!\nGame manual\nAs a little surprise I created a real physical manual for Ambermoon Advanced which can be ordered and printed on demand. Unfortunately it is still in the preparation phase. I will inform you if it is available.\nIt will contain many information about the changes but also has some valuable information of Ambermoon in general. For example detailed descriptions of conditions, attributes and skills which was lacking from the original manual. And it contains a small version of the original world map and rune table. Especially useful for people who don't possess the original box.\nIt also contains the element damage table and the complete spell book with SP and SLP costs, spell effect descriptions and so on. The SP and SLP values might differ from the original though.\nI also bought a few illustrations to make the manual a bit nicer so that it isn't just a boring piece of paper.\nThe manual will cost a bit. Basically the price will cover the production and illustration costs, print service fee and the rest is some kind of project support. In the end I will get around 2-3 euros per sold manual and you get a nice little illustrated book. Don't expect too much, I am neither an artist nor a writer. ;) But I thought this would be a cool idea.\nFeedback and support\nYour feedback is very welcome. For bug reports you may use the issue tracker here on github but you can also join our discord server or email me.\nIf you want to support this or other projects, you can donate or become a patron/sponsor.\n\nThank you very much.\nFAQ\n\nWhere can I find the disk images?\nUnfortunately at the current state there are none. The problem is that the new content is huge and the data won't fit onto the original 9+1 disks anymore. I invented some new compression algorithms but it still does not fit yet. I will try to make it possible later.\n\nHow to play it on the Amiga?\nWell basically the archives contain all the files like if you would install the game on a HDD. So just copy all the files into a folder on your Amiga HDD and start the game by clicking the Ambermoon icon in the root folder.\n\nHow to play on modern systems like Windows, Linux or Mac?\nJust head over to https://github.com/Pyrdacor/Ambermoon.net and check the downloads there. The remake contains the most recent version of Ambermoon Advanced as well. You can select it when you start the game.\n\nScreenshots\n\nHonorable mentions\nI had support from two hardworking testers. Crediar (remake) and macce (Amiga). Thank you very much for your support!",

    "content": "Some film­mak­ers start in com­mer­cials, hon­ing their chops in antic­i­pa­tion of mak­ing per­son­al projects lat­er. A select few go in the oth­er direc­tion, real­iz­ing their dis­tinc­tive vision before field­ing offers from com­pa­nies who want a piece of that vision’s cul­tur­al cur­ren­cy. Any­one who’s seen David Lynch’s most acclaimed workwill sus­pect, cor­rect­ly, that Lynch belongs in the lat­ter group. With 1977’s cult hitEraser­head, he showed cin­e­ma what it means to be Lynchi­an. This brought him the atten­tion of Hol­ly­wood, lead­ing to the respectable suc­cess ofThe Ele­phant Manandthe dis­as­ter that wasDune. Only in 1986, withBlue Vel­vet, could Lynch make a tru­ly, even trou­bling­ly per­son­al film that hit the zeit­geist at just the right moment.\nNat­u­ral­ly, Madi­son Avenue came call­ing soon there­after. “With the smash Blue Vel­vet, a Palme d’or at Cannes for Wild at Heart, and then the nation­al phe­nom­e­non of Twin Peaks’ first sea­son, David Lynch clear­ly estab­lished him­self as the U.S.A.‘s fore­most com­mer­cial­ly viable avant-garde-‘offbeat’ direc­tor,” wrote David Fos­ter Wal­lace in a 1997 piece on the film­mak­er.\n\n“For a while there it looked like he might be able to sin­gle-hand­ed­ly bro­ker a new mar­riage between art and com­merce in U.S. movies, open­ing for­mu­la-frozen Hol­ly­wood to some of the eccen­tric­i­ty and vig­or of art film.”Lynch’s fans in tele­vi­sion adver­tis­ing must have imag­ined that he could do the same for their indus­try, and you can watch the fruits of that hunch in the half-hour com­pi­la­tion of Lynch-direct­ed com­mer­cials above.\nLynch has worked for some star­tling­ly big brands, begin­ning with Calvin Klein: his trio of spots for the fra­granceObses­sion take as their basis the writ­ing of F. Scott Fitzger­ald, Ernest Hem­ing­way, and D.H. Lawrence. A few years lat­er he direct­ed a humor­ous mini-sea­son of Twin Peaks to pro­mote Geor­gia Cof­fee, one of the top brands of canned cof­fee in theLynch-lov­ing coun­try ofJapan. The New York Depart­ment of San­i­ta­tion engaged Lynch’s ser­vices to imbue their anti-lit­ter­ing cam­paign with his sig­na­ture high-con­trast omi­nous­ness, a mood also sought by fash­ion-indus­try titans like Armani, Yves Saint Lau­rent, Guc­ci, and Dior. The mar­keters of hum­bler goods like Alka-Seltzer, Bar­il­la Pas­ta (a seem­ing­ly auteur-aware brand that has also hired Wim Wen­ders and Felli­ni), and Clear Blue Easy home preg­nan­cy tests have also gone in for a touch of the Lynchi­an.\nQuite a few of these com­mer­cials orig­i­nal­ly aired only out­side Amer­i­ca, which may reflect the sup­pos­ed­ly more endur­ing appre­ci­a­tion of Lynch’s work that exists in Europe and Asia. But for all Lynch’s artis­tic dar­ing, the man him­self has always come off as an enthu­si­ast of unre­con­struct­ed Amer­i­can plea­sures. To this day he remains a stead­fast smok­er, and in 1998 brought that per­son­al cred­i­bil­i­ty to the Swiss cig­a­rette brand Parisi­enne. The result­ing spot fea­tures men in ties, show­ers of sparks, dead fish, back­wards talk­ing, a for­bid­ding­ly illu­mi­nat­ed shack, and apoc­a­lyp­tic flames:Parisi­enne, in oth­er words, must have got exact­ly what they paid for.\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\nWhat Makes a David Lynch Film Lynchi­an: A Video Essay\nDavid Lynch Made a Dis­turb­ing Web Sit­com Called “Rab­bits”: It’s Now Used by Psy­chol­o­gists to Induce a Sense of Exis­ten­tial Cri­sis in Research Sub­jects\nThe Sur­re­al Film­mak­ing of David Lynch Explained in 9 Video Essays\nWim Wen­ders Cre­ates Ads to Sell Beer (Stel­la Artois), Pas­ta (Bar­il­la), and More Beer (Car­ling)\nSpike Jonze’s Imag­i­na­tive TV Ads\nFellini’s Fan­tas­tic TV Com­mer­cials\nIng­mar Bergman’s 1950s Soap Com­mer­cials Wash Away the Exis­ten­tial Despair\nBased in Seoul,Col­in Mar­shallwrites and broad­castson cities and cul­ture.His projects include the bookThe State­less City: a Walk through 21st-Cen­tu­ry Los Ange­lesand the video seriesThe City in Cin­e­ma.

    "content": "By Claire L. EvansThe Big StoryMar 26, 2025 6:00 AMThe Worm That No Computer Scientist Can CrackOne of the simplest, most over-studied organisms in the world is the C. elegans nematode. For 13 years, a project called OpenWorm has tried—and utterly failed—to simulate it.Play/Pause ButtonPauseANIMATION: JOHN PROVENCHERSave this storySaveSave this storySaveThe Santa Ana winds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron, synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”At the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed. You’re doing, what, a cybercrime? my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain: No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.By the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed in Altadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”How to Get Computers—Before Computers Get YouPost-quantum algorithms, thermodynamic hardware, open source architectures, apocalypse-proof programming, and more: WIRED journeys to the freaky frontiers of modern computing.Larson is a cofounder of OpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about C. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.Unfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a C. elegans worm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.So much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.At this point, you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this: Uhh … why? Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?By way of an answer, I’ll offer one of the physicist Richard Feynman’s most famous dictums: What I cannot create, I do not understand. For much of its history, biology has been a reductionist science, driven by the principle that the best way to understand the mind-boggling complexity of living things is to dissect them into their constituent parts—organs, cells, proteins, molecules. But life isn’t a clockwork; it’s a dynamic system, and unexpected things emerge from the interactions between all those little parts. To truly understand life, you can’t just break it down. You have to be able to put it back together, too.The C. elegans nematode is a tiny worm, barely as long as a hair is wide, with less than a thousand cells in its body. Of those, only 302 are neurons—about as small as a brain can get. “I remember, when my first child was born, how proud I was when they reached the age they could count to 302,” said Netta Cohen, a computational neuroscientist who runs a worm lab at the University of Leeds. But there’s no shame in smallness, Cohen emphasized: C. elegans does a lot with a little. Unlike its more unpleasant cousins, it’s not a parasite, outsourcing its survival needs to bigger organisms. Instead, it’s what biologists call a “free-living” animal. “It can reproduce, it can eat, it can forage, it can escape,” Cohen said. “It’s born and it develops, and it ages and it dies—all in a millimeter.”Worm people like Cohen are quick to tell you that no fewer than four Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on C. elegans, which was the first animal to have both its genome sequenced and its neurons mapped. But there’s a difference between schematics and an operating manual. “We know the wiring; we don’t know the dynamics,” Cohen said. “You would think that’s an ideal problem for a physicist or a computer scientist or a mathematician to solve.”They’ve certainly tried. C. elegans’ first simulator was Sydney Brenner, who elevated the lowly worm from compost pile to scientific superstardom with his landmark 1986 paper “The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,” reverently known in worm circles as “The Mind of a Worm.” In a lab in Cambridge, England, Brenner’s team spent 13 years painstakingly slicing worms and photographing them through an electron microscope, relying on a first-generation minicomputer—the kind programmed with punched-paper tape—to reconstitute their data into a rudimentary map of the worm’s nervous system.Every 10 or 20 years since, computer scientists have attempted to expand on Brenner’s work. But biology tends to quickly humble the computer people. In 2003, the computer scientist David Harel pronounced the simulation of C. elegans a “grand challenge” for biology, a field that he considered overdue for an “extremely significant transition from analysis to synthesis.” Although Harel was surely right about that, he never managed to model more than the worm’s vulva—true story.For her part, Cohen has spent the better part of 20 years publishing breakthrough computational models that account for the sinusoidal squirm of C. elegans as it inches forward through different viscosities. But how the worm moves backward is an entirely different, unsolved problem—and don’t even ask about how a worm moves up and down, or, for that matter, why. All of the data we have about C. elegans behavior comes from worms in flat agar plates. For all we know, they might do things completely differently in the wild. “Why not?” Cohen said with a laugh. “It’s biology.”ILLUSTRATION: JOHN PROVENCHERWhen OpenWorm announced its intentions in 2011, Stephen Larson, an engineer who had “found religion” in open source, believed that if he could just convene a group of dedicated computational researchers to take a crack at biology, they might make meaningful progress on a simulation. Thirteen years later, he’s more contrite. “The project might be a cathedral,” Larson told me. “If I don’t have the ability to finish it, then at least other people can see it and build on it.”This could be burnout talking; spearheading an open source project on a shoestring, for any amount of time, can sap even the most dedicated idealist. It could be the deceptive complexity of C. elegans’ brain, which continues to defy easy capture. It could also just be bad timing.OpenWorm doesn’t do its own research. Instead, the project’s cohort of volunteers culls from the C. elegans literature, integrating into their simulation whatever data they can find. This means they’re reliant on worm labs like Cohen’s, which have been slow to produce the kind of inputs that are really useful for a computational effort. But over the past decade or so, experimentalists have powered up microscopes and refined genetic techniques, producing more and better recordings of the worm’s brain as it goes about its business. At the same time, machine-learning tools have emerged to make sense of all that data, and computational power is through the roof. The convergence makes Larson hopeful. “When you’re in a time of almost exponential technological expansion, something that sounds crazy is maybe doable,” he said.I asked Cohen, who serves on OpenWorm’s scientific advisory panel, if it is, in fact, doable. “Well, let’s start from the premise that it is,” she said. “What do we need to do?” Cohen is one of 37 coauthors on a recent opinion paper outlining a new plan: Use genetic imaging technology to activate each neuron in the worm’s nervous system one by one, measuring its effect on the other 301. Repeated hundreds of thousands of times in parallel experiments, this methodical process should hoover up enough data to give the computational folks, finally, something to work with—enough, even, to “reverse engineer” the worm completely.It’s an ambitious proposal, one that will require an unprecedented level of collaboration between some 20 different worm labs. Gal Haspel, a computational neuroscientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the lead author on the reverse engineering paper, estimates that pulling it off may take up to 10 years, cost tens of millions of dollars, and require something in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 200,000 real-life worms. In the process, it will generate more data about C. elegans than has been collected in all of science to date. And what, in the end, will the reverse engineers have to show for it? “All these people and all these computers,” Haspel said. “And we’ll end up doing what one little animal can do right now.”He’s being wry. Haspel also compared the project to a NASA moonshot: It’s the kind of undertaking that drives technology forward, pushing engineers to build better tools and scientists to work together. The worm simulation is an opportunity, Haspel believes, for a new kind of science, one driven by automation, big data, and machine learning. And although the end product is only a worm, and an expensive, inefficient one at that—in a sense the world’s most sophisticated Tamagotchi—it can be a stepping stone toward understanding more complex nervous systems and eventually, someday, the human mind.ILLUSTRATION: JOHN PROVENCHERLast summer, a crypto developer posted an animated GIF on X of a virtual C. elegans worm bonking around an onscreen window. The animation was generated using the same code I ran on my own laptop, which is freely available on OpenWorm’s GitHub. “If the worm matrix runs on my M1 Mac,” he pronounced, “what are the chances we are actually in base reality?” Maybe we’re the worms, he meant—and, on a cosmic MacBook on some higher plane of reality, someone’s running us. The post went viral; Elon Musk, of course, liked it.When I mentioned the worm matrix to OpenWorm’s project director, Padraig Gleeson, a computational neuroscientist at University College London, he visibly winced. “Some people come to this because they want philosophical discussions about this type of thing. That’s fine,” he said. “My priority is that it’d be very nice to actually look at the biology.”Gleeson is the Woz to Larson’s Jobs—he’s less interested in building the Überworm than he is in a platform that bundles smaller, more granular models of C. elegans’ biological machinery. Computational modeling is common practice in biology; it’s an inexpensive way to encode and test theories as “thought experiments” before breaking out the agar plates and worm food. Usually, biological models concern some small aspect of the organism being studied—the handful of neurons, say, driving forward locomotion. When it comes to modeling, “we don’t want the map to be as good as the territory. That would defeat the purpose,” explained Eduardo Izquierdo, a computational neuroscientist at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who focuses on worm modeling. “We’re looking for something to help us think through things.”Nobody would confuse a biological model with the real thing. But a full-on simulation opens a very different can of worms. To borrow Izquierdo’s reference, it is a map as good as the territory—and as such, it invites new speculation about the nature of that territory, to say nothing of life itself. If a model helps scientists answer questions, a simulation raises them. Like, what separates a virtual worm from its living kin, if the two are identical down to the molecule?The way Larson sees it, a fully faithful worm simulation will be a category-expanding event: Rather than invalidating our current understanding of life, it might broaden it. “If we want to say that aliveness can only be satisfied by systems of physical molecules that physically exist with mass in the planet, something in a computer that doesn’t have physical molecules cannot be alive,” he said. “But if we expand our definition of aliveness to instead be more about information, then perhaps there is a version of aliveness that you could apply to a simulated animal. And then the question is, does it matter?”I think it matters. Life is information, but it’s something more, too—something we feel most strongly when it’s gone. I wonder if, in this light, Feynman’s dictum shouldn’t be amended. It’s not that creation breeds understanding, exactly. It’s that only by attempting to re-create life can we come to understand how irreplaceable it is.Of course, I say this because I’m surrounded by destruction. The air is toxic now, and flakes of white ash have eddied into every crevice of the house. At the edge of the evacuation zone, close enough to smell the smoke, I’m keeping myself distracted by cooking up more and more C. elegans proto-simulations. Watching them, I can’t help but marvel at how easy it is to destroy life, and how difficult it is to create it. All it takes is a single spark to torch centuries of growth overnight—but to prompt one sluggish inch forward from a virtual worm? That’s the work of decades, and it may never be finished.Let us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

      "en": "The text discusses the challenges faced by the OpenWorm project, which has been trying for 13 years to create a computer simulation of the tiny nematode worm, C. elegans. This organism, although simple with only 302 neurons, has proven to be incredibly complex to simulate accurately. The project's goal is to create a digital twin of the worm that can mimic its behavior and interactions, which could help scientists better understand biological systems.\n\nDespite the worm being one of the most studied organisms, the simulation has not yet succeeded in capturing its dynamics. Current attempts involve translating experimental data into a computational framework, but the results are slow and limited. The article highlights the importance of understanding life not just by breaking it down into parts but also by recreating it in a virtual environment.\n\nExperts involved in the project recognize the difficulties and emphasize the potential benefits of collaboration and advancements in technology. They are exploring new methods to gather data on the worm's nervous system, which could eventually lead to a complete model. This ambitious effort is likened to a \"moonshot\" in science, as it could lead to breakthroughs in understanding not just C. elegans, but more complex nervous systems, including the human brain.\n\nUltimately, the text reflects on the paradox of creating life-like simulations, noting that while it is easy to destroy life, recreating it—even virtually—is a monumental challenge that requires significant time and effort.",

    "content": "Python\n\n        uv\n\nSelf-contained Python scripts with uv\n\nTLDR\nYou can add uv into the shebang line for a Python script to make it a self-contained executable.\n\nI am working on a Go project to better learn the language. It's a simple API backed by a postgres database.\nWhen I need to test out an endpoint, I prefer to use the httpx python package inside an\nipython REPL over making curl requests. It's nice to be able to introspect responses and easily\npackage payloads with dicts instead of writing out JSON.\nAnyway, I decided to write a script to upsert some user data so that I can beat on my /users endpoint.\n\nMy jam_users.py script looks like this:\nimport httpx\nimport IPython\nfrom loguru import logger\n\nusers = [\n    dict(name=\"The Dude\", email=\"the.dude@abides.com\", password=\"thedudeabides\"),\n    dict(name=\"Walter Sobchak\", email=\"walter@sobchak-security.com\", password=\"vietnamvet\"),\n    dict(name=\"Donnie\", email=\"donniesurfs@yahoo.com\", password=\"iamthewalrus\"),\n    dict(name=\"Maude\", email=\"mauddie@avant-guard.com\", password=\"goodmanandthorough\"),\n]\n\nr = httpx.get(\"http://localhost:4000/v1/users\")\nr.raise_for_status()\n\nfor user in r.json()[\"users\"]:\n    logger.info(f\"Deleting: {user['name']}\")\n    r = httpx.delete(f\"http://localhost:4000/v1/users/{user['id']}\")\n    r.raise_for_status()\n\nfor user in users:\n    r = httpx.post(\"http://localhost:4000/v1/users\", json=user)\n    r.raise_for_status()\n    logger.info(f\"Created: {r.json()}\")\n\nIPython.embed()\n\nThis is really straight-forward. It will clear out any existing users and then insert these test users. Right after\nthat, I get dropped into an ipython repl to do what I need for testing. All I have to do is run:\npython jam_users.py\n\nHowever, if I want to run the script as-is, I will need to choose one of these approaches:\n\nInstall the dependencies httpx, IPython, and loguru globally in my system python\nCreate a virtual environment, activate it, install deps, and run my script while the venv is activated\n\nThese are both not great options in my opinion. These approaches also rely on having a system python installed that is\ncompatible with these packages. This isn't as big of a problem, but something to consider anyway.\nI've been using uv a lot lately, and I'm becoming quite enamoured with its usefulness\nas a package manager, efficiency as a pip replacement, and abilities for isolated python executables. One thing that I\nhaven't used much yet are the special # /// script tags in a python script.\nWhen I first read about this functionality, I was pretty skeptical. I'm not particularly keen on embedding syntax into\ncomments. However, this seemed like the perfect application. So, updated my script to include the deps in the script\nheader like so:\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"ipython\", \"httpx\", \"loguru\"]\n# ///\nimport httpx\nimport IPython\nfrom loguru import logger\n\n...\n\nWith this added, now I can run the script really easily with uv:\nuv run jam_users.py\n\nGreat! Now, uv will create an isolated virtual environment for the script, download the dependencies and install them,\nand then run my script in the context of that venv! I don't have to manage the virtual environment myself nor worry\nabout cluttering my system python with packages that I will invariably forget to remove later.\nOne nice thing about a regular Python script, though, is that you can make it executable with a shebang line:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n...\n\nNow, if I make the script executable (chmod +x jam_users.py), I can invoke it directly as an executable script!\nHowever, this won't take advantage of the uv script header because Python itself will just ignore the comment.\nSo, I did some digging and found out that you can actually embed the invocation of the uv command right in the shebang\nline like so:\n#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"ipython\", \"httpx\", \"loguru\"]\n# ///\nimport httpx\nimport IPython\nfrom loguru import logger\n\n...\n\nThis works because the -S flag tells the system to split everything after it into separate arguments before passing it\nto the system's env.\nNow (after chmod +x jam_users.py, of course), I can execute my script directly:\n./jam_users.py\n\nThat's it! What's even better is that I can run this script on any (Unix) system that has uv installed without needing\nto do ANY dependency or virtual environment management.\nNow, this script itself is really trivial and not much more than a toy example. However, in my past I have written\nrather complex scripts that I needed to hand off to other users to run. Of course, this always came with a long\nexplanation of how to prepare their system just to run the script. This approach solves that problem instantly and\npainlessly (as long as they have uv installed).\nTake it for a spin, and let me know your thoughts.\nThanks for reading!\n\n  Comments\n\n    var giscus = document.querySelector(\"script[src*=giscus]\")\n\n    // Set palette on initial load\n    var palette = __md_get(\"__palette\")\n    if (palette && typeof palette.color === \"object\") {\n      var theme = palette.color.scheme === \"slate\"\n        ? \"transparent_dark\"\n        : \"light\"\n\n      // Instruct Giscus to set theme\n      giscus.setAttribute(\"data-theme\", theme)\n    }\n\n    // Register event handlers after documented loaded\n    document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\n      var ref = document.querySelector(\"[data-md-component=palette]\")\n      ref.addEventListener(\"change\", function() {\n        var palette = __md_get(\"__palette\")\n        if (palette && typeof palette.color === \"object\") {\n          var theme = palette.color.scheme === \"slate\"\n            ? \"transparent_dark\"\n            : \"light\"\n\n          // Instruct Giscus to change theme\n          var frame = document.querySelector(\".giscus-frame\")\n          frame.contentWindow.postMessage(\n            { giscus: { setConfig: { theme } } },\n            \"https://giscus.app\"\n          )\n        }\n      })\n    })",

      "ko": "Ente Photos는 5년간의 개발과 40,000건 이상의 코드 업데이트를 거쳐 첫 번째 주요 버전인 v1을 출시했습니다. 이 앱은 사진 저장에서 개인 정보 보호와 편리함을 결합하는 데 중점을 두고 있으며, 사용자만이 사진에 접근할 수 있도록 종단 간 암호화를 제공합니다.\n\nv1의 주요 기능으로는 강력한 암호화를 통한 개인 정보 보호, 얼굴 인식 및 검색 기능의 개발이 포함됩니다. 이 기능들은 도전적이었지만 결국 성공적으로 구현되었습니다. 사용자는 인터넷 없이도 사진 속 인물, 사물, 장면을 로컬에서 검색할 수 있습니다. 또한, 앱은 중요한 인물과 기억을 강조하며, 홈스크린 위젯을 통해 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 합니다. 데이터는 세 개의 서로 다른 클라우드 위치에 안전하게 저장되며, 그 중 하나는 대피소에 백업되어 있습니다. Ente는 일부 대형 기술 회사와 달리 다양한 기기에서 데이터에 접근할 수 있도록 허용합니다.\n\n커뮤니티 기능으로는 공유 링크, 가족 계획, 게스트 보기, 기억을 전할 수 있는 유산 기능이 포함되어 있습니다. 사용자는 자신의 서버에서 Ente를 실행할 수 있는 오픈 소스 옵션도 제공합니다.\n\n앞으로 팀은 비디오 스트리밍, 새로운 갤러리 레이아웃, 계정이 필요 없는 로컬 우선 버전을 도입할 계획입니다. 그들은 여정에 도움을 준 모든 이들에게 감사의 뜻을 전하며, Ente Photos의 발전에 함께할 사람들을 초대합니다. 2025년 4월 5일에는 커뮤니티 AMA를 개최할 예정입니다.",
      "ja": "Ente Photosは、5年間の開発と4万回以上のコード更新を経て、初のメジャーバージョンであるv1をリリースしました。このアプリは、写真の保存においてプライバシーと利便性を兼ね備えることに重点を置いており、エンドツーエンドの暗号化を採用しているため、ユーザーだけが自分の写真にアクセスできます。\n\nv1の主な特徴には、強力な暗号化によるユーザーデータの保護、顔認識や検索機能の開発が難しかったものの成功したシンプルさがあります。ユーザーは、インターネット接続なしで、自分の写真の中から人や物、シーンを検索することができます。また、アプリは重要な人々や思い出を強調し、ホーム画面のウィジェットを通じて簡単にアクセスできるようになっています。\n\nデータは、異なる3つのクラウドロケーションに安全に保存されており、フォールアウトシェルターにバックアップもあります。大手テクノロジー企業とは異なり、Enteはさまざまなデバイスからデータにアクセスできるようにしています。コミュニティ機能としては、共有リンク、家族プラン、ゲストビュー、思い出を引き継ぐためのレガシー機能が含まれています。また、ユーザーは自分のサーバーでEnteを運用することも可能です。\n\n今後の計画として、チームは動画ストリーミング、新しいギャラリーのレイアウト、アカウント不要のローカルファーストバージョンの導入を予定しています。彼らは、これまでのサポートに感謝し、今後の開発に参加するよう他の人々を招待しています。2025年4月5日にはコミュニティのAMA（何でも聞いてください）を開催する予定です。"
